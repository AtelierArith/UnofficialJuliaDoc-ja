```
var(itr; corrected::Bool=true, mean=nothing[, dims])
```

Compute the sample variance of collection `itr`.

The algorithm returns an estimator of the generative distribution's variance under the assumption that each entry of `itr` is a sample drawn from the same unknown distribution, with the samples uncorrelated. For arrays, this computation is equivalent to calculating `sum((itr .- mean(itr)).^2) / (length(itr) - 1)`. If `corrected` is `true`, then the sum is scaled with `n-1`, whereas the sum is scaled with `n` if `corrected` is `false` where `n` is the number of elements in `itr`.

If `itr` is an `AbstractArray`, `dims` can be provided to compute the variance over dimensions.

A pre-computed `mean` may be provided. When `dims` is specified, `mean` must be an array with the same shape as `mean(itr, dims=dims)` (additional trailing singleton dimensions are allowed).

!!! note
    If array contains `NaN` or [`missing`](@ref) values, the result is also `NaN` or `missing` (`missing` takes precedence if array contains both). Use the [`skipmissing`](@ref) function to omit `missing` entries and compute the variance of non-missing values.
