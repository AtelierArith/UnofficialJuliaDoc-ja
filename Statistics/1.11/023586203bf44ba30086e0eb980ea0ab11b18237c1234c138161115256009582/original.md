```
cov(X::AbstractVecOrMat, Y::AbstractVecOrMat; dims::Int=1, corrected::Bool=true)
```

Compute the covariance between the vectors or matrices `X` and `Y` along the dimension `dims`. If `corrected` is `true` (the default) then the sum is scaled with `n-1`, whereas the sum is scaled with `n` if `corrected` is `false` where `n = size(X, dims) = size(Y, dims)`.
