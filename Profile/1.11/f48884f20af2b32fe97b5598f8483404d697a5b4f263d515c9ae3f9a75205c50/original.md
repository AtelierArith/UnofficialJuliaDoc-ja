```
print([io::IO = stdout,] data::Vector, lidict::LineInfoDict; kwargs...)
```

Prints profiling results to `io`. This variant is used to examine results exported by a previous call to [`retrieve`](@ref). Supply the vector `data` of backtraces and a dictionary `lidict` of line information.

See `Profile.print([io], data)` for an explanation of the valid keyword arguments.
