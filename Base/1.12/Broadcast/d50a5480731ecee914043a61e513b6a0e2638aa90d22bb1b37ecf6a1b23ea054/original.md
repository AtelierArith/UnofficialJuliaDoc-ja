`Broadcast.DefaultArrayStyle{N}()` is a [`BroadcastStyle`](@ref) indicating that an object behaves as an `N`-dimensional array for broadcasting. Specifically, `DefaultArrayStyle` is used for any `AbstractArray` type that hasn't defined a specialized style, and in the absence of overrides from other `broadcast` arguments the resulting output type is `Array`. When there are multiple inputs to `broadcast`, `DefaultArrayStyle` "loses" to any other [`Broadcast.ArrayStyle`](@ref).
