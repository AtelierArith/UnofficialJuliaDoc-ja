```julia
Threads.atomic_max!(x::Atomic{T}, val::T) where T
```

Atomically store the maximum of `x` and `val` in `x`

Performs `x[] = max(x[], val)` atomically. Returns the **old** value.

For further details, see LLVM's `atomicrmw max` instruction.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = Threads.Atomic{Int}(5)
Base.Threads.Atomic{Int64}(5)

julia> Threads.atomic_max!(x, 7)
5

julia> x[]
7
```
