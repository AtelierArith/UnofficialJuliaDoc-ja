```
AbstractIrrational <: Real
```

Number type representing an exact irrational value, which is automatically rounded to the correct precision in arithmetic operations with other numeric quantities.

Subtypes `MyIrrational <: AbstractIrrational` should implement at least `==(::MyIrrational, ::MyIrrational)`, `hash(x::MyIrrational, h::UInt)`, and `convert(::Type{F}, x::MyIrrational) where {F <: Union{BigFloat,Float32,Float64}}`.

If a subtype is used to represent values that may occasionally be rational (e.g. a square-root type that represents `âˆšn` for integers `n` will give a rational result when `n` is a perfect square), then it should also implement `isinteger`, `iszero`, `isone`, and `==` with `Real` values (since all of these default to `false` for `AbstractIrrational` types), as well as defining [`hash`](@ref) to equal that of the corresponding `Rational`.
