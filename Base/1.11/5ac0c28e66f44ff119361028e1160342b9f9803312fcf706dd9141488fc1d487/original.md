```
countlines(io::IO; eol::AbstractChar = '\n')
countlines(filename::AbstractString; eol::AbstractChar = '\n')
```

Read `io` until the end of the stream/file and count the number of lines. To specify a file pass the filename as the first argument. EOL markers other than `'\n'` are supported by passing them as the second argument.  The last non-empty line of `io` is counted even if it does not end with the EOL, matching the length returned by [`eachline`](@ref) and [`readlines`](@ref).

To count lines of a `String`, `countlines(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> eof(io) # counting lines moves the file pointer
true

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io, eol = '.')
1
```

```jldoctest
julia> write("my_file.txt", "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n")
36

julia> countlines("my_file.txt")
1

julia> countlines("my_file.txt", eol = 'n')
4

julia> rm("my_file.txt")

```
