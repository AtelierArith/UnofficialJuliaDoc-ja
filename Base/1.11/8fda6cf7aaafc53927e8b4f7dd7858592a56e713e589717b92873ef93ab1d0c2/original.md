```
@time expr
@time "description" expr
```

A macro to execute an expression, printing the time it took to execute, the number of allocations, and the total number of bytes its execution caused to be allocated, before returning the value of the expression. Any time spent garbage collecting (gc), compiling new code, or recompiling invalidated code is shown as a percentage. Any lock conflicts where a [`ReentrantLock`](@ref) had to wait are shown as a count.

Optionally provide a description string to print before the time report.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@time` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@time @eval ...`.

See also [`@showtime`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), [`@allocated`](@ref), and [`@allocations`](@ref).

!!! note
    For more serious benchmarking, consider the `@btime` macro from the BenchmarkTools.jl package which among other things evaluates the function multiple times in order to reduce noise.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The option to add a description was introduced in Julia 1.8.

    Recompilation time being shown separately from compilation time was introduced in Julia 1.8


!!! compat "Julia 1.11"
    The reporting of any lock conflicts was added in Julia 1.11.
