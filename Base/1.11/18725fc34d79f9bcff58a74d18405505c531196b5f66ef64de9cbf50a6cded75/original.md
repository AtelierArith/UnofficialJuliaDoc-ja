```
view(A, inds...)
```

Like [`getindex`](@ref), but returns a lightweight array that lazily references (or is effectively a *view* into) the parent array `A` at the given index or indices `inds` instead of eagerly extracting elements or constructing a copied subset. Calling [`getindex`](@ref) or [`setindex!`](@ref) on the returned value (often a [`SubArray`](@ref)) computes the indices to access or modify the parent array on the fly.  The behavior is undefined if the shape of the parent array is changed after `view` is called because there is no bound check for the parent array; e.g., it may cause a segmentation fault.

Some immutable parent arrays (like ranges) may choose to simply recompute a new array in some circumstances instead of returning a `SubArray` if doing so is efficient and provides compatible semantics.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    In Julia 1.6 or later, `view` can be called on an `AbstractString`, returning a `SubString`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2Ã—2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> b = view(A, :, 1)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1
 3

julia> fill!(b, 0)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 0
 0

julia> A # Note A has changed even though we modified b
2Ã—2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  2
 0  4

julia> view(2:5, 2:3) # returns a range as type is immutable
3:4
```
