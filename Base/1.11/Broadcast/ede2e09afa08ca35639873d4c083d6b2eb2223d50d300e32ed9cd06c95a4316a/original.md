`Broadcast.ArrayStyle{MyArrayType}()` is a [`BroadcastStyle`](@ref) indicating that an object behaves as an array for broadcasting. It presents a simple way to construct [`Broadcast.AbstractArrayStyle`](@ref)s for specific `AbstractArray` container types. Broadcast styles created this way lose track of dimensionality; if keeping track is important for your type, you should create your own custom [`Broadcast.AbstractArrayStyle`](@ref).
