`BroadcastStyle` is an abstract type and trait-function used to determine behavior of objects under broadcasting. `BroadcastStyle(typeof(x))` returns the style associated with `x`. To customize the broadcasting behavior of a type, one can declare a style by defining a type/method pair

```
struct MyContainerStyle <: BroadcastStyle end
Base.BroadcastStyle(::Type{<:MyContainer}) = MyContainerStyle()
```

One then writes method(s) (at least [`similar`](@ref)) operating on `Broadcasted{MyContainerStyle}`. There are also several pre-defined subtypes of `BroadcastStyle` that you may be able to leverage; see the [Interfaces chapter](@ref man-interfaces-broadcasting) for more information.
