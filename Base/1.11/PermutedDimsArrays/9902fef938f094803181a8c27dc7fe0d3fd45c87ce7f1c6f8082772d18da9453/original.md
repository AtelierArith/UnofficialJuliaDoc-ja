```
permutedims!(dest, src, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `src` and store the result in the array `dest`. `perm` is a vector specifying a permutation of length `ndims(src)`. The preallocated array `dest` should have `size(dest) == size(src)[perm]` and is completely overwritten. No in-place permutation is supported and unexpected results will happen if `src` and `dest` have overlapping memory regions.

See also [`permutedims`](@ref).
