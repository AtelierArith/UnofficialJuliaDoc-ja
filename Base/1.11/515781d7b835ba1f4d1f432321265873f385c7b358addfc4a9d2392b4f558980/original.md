```
get(f::Union{Function, Type}, collection, key)
```

Return the value stored for the given key, or if no mapping for the key is present, return `f()`.  Use [`get!`](@ref) to also store the default value in the dictionary.

This is intended to be called using `do` block syntax

```julia
get(dict, key) do
    # default value calculated here
    time()
end
```
