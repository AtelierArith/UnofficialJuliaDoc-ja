```
foldl(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

See also [`mapfoldl`](@ref), [`foldr`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldl(=>, 1:4)
((1 => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> foldl(=>, 1:4; init=0)
(((0 => 1) => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> accumulate(=>, (1,2,3,4))
(1, 1 => 2, (1 => 2) => 3, ((1 => 2) => 3) => 4)
```
