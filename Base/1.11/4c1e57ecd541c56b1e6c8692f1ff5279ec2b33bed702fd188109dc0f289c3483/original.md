```
cumsum(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum along the dimension `dims`. See also [`cumsum!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> cumsum(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 5  7  9

julia> cumsum(a, dims=2)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  3   6
 4  9  15
```

!!! note
    The return array's `eltype` is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size  and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size. To preserve `eltype` of arrays with small signed or unsigned integer `accumulate(+, A)` should be used.

    ```jldoctest
    julia> cumsum(Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int64}:
     100
     128

    julia> accumulate(+,Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int8}:
      100
     -128
    ```

    In the former case, the integers are widened to system word size and therefore the result is `Int64[100, 128]`. In the latter case, no such widening happens and integer overflow results in `Int8[100, -128]`.
