```
contains(haystack::AbstractString, needle)
```

Return `true` if `haystack` contains `needle`. This is the same as `occursin(needle, haystack)`, but is provided for consistency with `startswith(haystack, needle)` and `endswith(haystack, needle)`.

See also [`occursin`](@ref), [`in`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref).

julia> contains("aba", r"a.a")

julia> contains("abba", r"a.a")

```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
