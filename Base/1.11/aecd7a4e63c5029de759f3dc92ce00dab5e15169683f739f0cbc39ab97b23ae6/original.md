```
fld(x, y)
```

Largest integer less than or equal to `x / y`. Equivalent to `div(x, y, RoundDown)`.

See also [`div`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fld(7.3, 5.5)
1.0

julia> fld.(-5:5, 3)'
1Ã—11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -2  -1  -1  -1  0  0  0  1  1  1
```

Because `fld(x, y)` implements strictly correct floored rounding based on the true value of floating-point numbers, unintuitive situations can arise. For example:

```jldoctest
julia> fld(6.0, 0.1)
59.0
julia> 6.0 / 0.1
60.0
julia> 6.0 / big(0.1)
59.99999999999999666933092612453056361837965690217069245739573412231113406246995
```

What is happening here is that the true value of the floating-point number written as `0.1` is slightly larger than the numerical value 1/10 while `6.0` represents the number 6 precisely. Therefore the true value of `6.0 / 0.1` is slightly less than 60. When doing division, this is rounded to precisely `60.0`, but `fld(6.0, 0.1)` always takes the floor of the true value, so the result is `59.0`.
