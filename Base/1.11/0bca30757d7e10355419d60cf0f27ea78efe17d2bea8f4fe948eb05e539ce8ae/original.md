```
unsafe_copyto!(dest::Ptr{T}, src::Ptr{T}, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from a source pointer to a destination, with no checking. The size of an element is determined by the type of the pointers.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointers `dest` and `src` to ensure that they are valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.
