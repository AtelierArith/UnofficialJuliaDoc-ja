```
similar(storagetype, axes)
```

Create an uninitialized mutable array analogous to that specified by `storagetype`, but with `axes` specified by the last argument.

**Examples**:

```
similar(Array{Int}, axes(A))
```

creates an array that "acts like" an `Array{Int}` (and might indeed be backed by one), but which is indexed identically to `A`. If `A` has conventional indexing, this will be identical to `Array{Int}(undef, size(A))`, but if `A` has unconventional indexing then the indices of the result will match `A`.

```
similar(BitArray, (axes(A, 2),))
```

would create a 1-dimensional logical array whose indices match those of the columns of `A`.
