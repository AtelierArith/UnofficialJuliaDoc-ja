```
@nloops N itersym rangeexpr bodyexpr
@nloops N itersym rangeexpr preexpr bodyexpr
@nloops N itersym rangeexpr preexpr postexpr bodyexpr
```

Generate `N` nested loops, using `itersym` as the prefix for the iteration variables. `rangeexpr` may be an anonymous-function expression, or a simple symbol `var` in which case the range is `axes(var, d)` for dimension `d`.

Optionally, you can provide "pre" and "post" expressions. These get executed first and last, respectively, in the body of each loop. For example:

```
@nloops 2 i A d -> j_d = min(i_d, 5) begin
    s += @nref 2 A j
end
```

would generate:

```
for i_2 = axes(A, 2)
    j_2 = min(i_2, 5)
    for i_1 = axes(A, 1)
        j_1 = min(i_1, 5)
        s += A[j_1, j_2]
    end
end
```

If you want just a post-expression, supply [`nothing`](@ref) for the pre-expression. Using parentheses and semicolons, you can supply multi-statement expressions.
