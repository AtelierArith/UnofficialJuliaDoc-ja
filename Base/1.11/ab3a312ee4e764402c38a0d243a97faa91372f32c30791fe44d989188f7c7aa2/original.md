```
@threadcall((cfunc, clib), rettype, (argtypes...), argvals...)
```

The `@threadcall` macro is called in the same way as [`ccall`](@ref) but does the work in a different thread. This is useful when you want to call a blocking C function without causing the current `julia` thread to become blocked. Concurrency is limited by size of the libuv thread pool, which defaults to 4 threads but can be increased by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable and restarting the `julia` process.

Note that the called function should never call back into Julia.
