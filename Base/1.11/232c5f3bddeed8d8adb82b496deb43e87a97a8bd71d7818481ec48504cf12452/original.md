```
abs(x)
```

The absolute value of `x`.

When `abs` is applied to signed integers, overflow may occur, resulting in the return of a negative value. This overflow occurs only when `abs` is applied to the minimum representable value of a signed integer. That is, when `x == typemin(typeof(x))`, `abs(x) == x < 0`, not `-x` as might be expected.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> abs(-3)
3

julia> abs(1 + im)
1.4142135623730951

julia> abs.(Int8[-128 -127 -126 0 126 127])  # overflow at typemin(Int8)
1Ã—6 Matrix{Int8}:
 -128  127  126  0  126  127

julia> maximum(abs, [1, -2, 3, -4])
4
