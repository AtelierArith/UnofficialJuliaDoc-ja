```
CFunction struct
```

Garbage-collection handle for the return value from `@cfunction` when the first argument is annotated with '$'. Like all `cfunction` handles, it should be passed to `ccall` as a `Ptr{Cvoid}`, and will be converted automatically at the call site to the appropriate type.

See [`@cfunction`](@ref).
