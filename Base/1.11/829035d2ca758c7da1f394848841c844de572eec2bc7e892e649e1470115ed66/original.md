IndexLinear()
```

Subtype of [`IndexStyle`](@ref) used to describe arrays which are optimally indexed by one linear index.

A linear indexing style uses one integer index to describe the position in the array (even if it's a multidimensional array) and column-major ordering is used to efficiently access the elements. This means that requesting [`eachindex`](@ref) from an array that is `IndexLinear` will return a simple one-dimensional range, even if it is multidimensional.

A custom array that reports its `IndexStyle` as `IndexLinear` only needs to implement indexing (and indexed assignment) with a single `Int` index; all other indexing expressions — including multidimensional accesses — will be recomputed to the linear index.  For example, if `A` were a `2×3` custom matrix with linear indexing, and we referenced `A[1, 3]`, this would be recomputed to the equivalent linear index and call `A[5]` since `1 + 2*(3 - 1) = 5`.
