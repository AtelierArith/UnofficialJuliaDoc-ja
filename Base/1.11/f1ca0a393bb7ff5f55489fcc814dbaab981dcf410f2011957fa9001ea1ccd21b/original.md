```
extrema(itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` element in a single pass, and return them as a 2-tuple.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). As a consequence, when `itr` is empty the returned `(mn, mx)` tuple will satisfy `mn â‰¥ mx`. When `init` is specified it may be used even for non-empty `itr`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.8 or later.
