```
Experimental.register_error_hint(handler, exceptiontype)
```

Register a "hinting" function `handler(io, exception)` that can suggest potential ways for users to circumvent errors.  `handler` should examine `exception` to see whether the conditions appropriate for a hint are met, and if so generate output to `io`. Packages should call `register_error_hint` from within their `__init__` function.

For specific exception types, `handler` is required to accept additional arguments:

  * `MethodError`: provide `handler(io, exc::MethodError, argtypes, kwargs)`, which splits the combined arguments into positional and keyword arguments.

When issuing a hint, the output should typically start with `\n`.

If you define custom exception types, your `showerror` method can support hints by calling [`Experimental.show_error_hints`](@ref).

# Examples

```
julia> module Hinter

       only_int(x::Int)      = 1
       any_number(x::Number) = 2

       function __init__()
           Base.Experimental.register_error_hint(MethodError) do io, exc, argtypes, kwargs
               if exc.f == only_int
                    # Color is not necessary, this is just to show it's possible.
                    print(io, "\nDid you mean to call ")
                    printstyled(io, "`any_number`?", color=:cyan)
               end
           end
       end

       end
```

Then if you call `Hinter.only_int` on something that isn't an `Int` (thereby triggering a `MethodError`), it issues the hint:

```
julia> Hinter.only_int(1.0)
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching only_int(::Float64)
The function `only_int` exists, but no method is defined for this combination of argument types.
Did you mean to call `any_number`?
Closest candidates are:
    ...
