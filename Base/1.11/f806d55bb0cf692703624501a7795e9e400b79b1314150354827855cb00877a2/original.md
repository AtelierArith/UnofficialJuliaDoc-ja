```
replace(A, old_new::Pair...; [count::Integer])
```

Return a copy of collection `A` where, for each pair `old=>new` in `old_new`, all occurrences of `old` are replaced by `new`. Equality is determined using [`isequal`](@ref). If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` occurrences in total.

The element type of the result is chosen using promotion (see [`promote_type`](@ref)) based on the element type of `A` and on the types of the `new` values in pairs. If `count` is omitted and the element type of `A` is a `Union`, the element type of the result will not include singleton types which are replaced with values of a different type: for example, `Union{T,Missing}` will become `T` if `missing` is replaced.

See also [`replace!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`insert!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Version 1.7 is required to replace elements of a `Tuple`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> replace([1, 2, 1, 3], 1=>0, 2=>4, count=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 4
 1
 3

julia> replace([1, missing], missing=>0)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 0
```
