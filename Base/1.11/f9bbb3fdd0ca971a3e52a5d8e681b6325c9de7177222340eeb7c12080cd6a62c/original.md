```
findmin(f, domain) -> (f(x), index)
```

Return a pair of a value in the codomain (outputs of `f`) and the index or key of the corresponding value in the `domain` (inputs to `f`) such that `f(x)` is minimised. If there are multiple minimal points, then the first one will be returned.

`domain` must be a non-empty iterable.

Indices are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(domain)`](@ref) and [`pairs(domain)`](@ref).

`NaN` is treated as less than all other values except `missing`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This method requires Julia 1.7 or later.

julia> findmin(first, [(2, :a), (2, :b), (3, :c)])
(2, 1)

julia> findmin(cos, 0:π/2:2π)
(-1.0, 3)
