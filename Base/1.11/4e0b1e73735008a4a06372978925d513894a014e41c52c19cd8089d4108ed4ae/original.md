```
append!(collection, collections...) -> collection.
```

For an ordered container `collection`, add the elements of each `collections` to the end of it.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Specifying multiple collections to be appended requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> append!([1], [2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> append!([1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6])
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```

Use [`push!`](@ref) to add individual items to `collection` which are not already themselves in another collection. The result of the preceding example is equivalent to `push!([1, 2, 3], 4, 5, 6)`.

See [`sizehint!`](@ref) for notes about the performance model.

See also [`vcat`](@ref) for vectors, [`union!`](@ref) for sets, and [`prepend!`](@ref) and [`pushfirst!`](@ref) for the opposite order.
