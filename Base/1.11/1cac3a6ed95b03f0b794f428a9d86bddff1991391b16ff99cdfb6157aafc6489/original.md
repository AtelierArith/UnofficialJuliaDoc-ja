```
download(url::AbstractString, [path::AbstractString = tempname()]) -> path
```

Download a file from the given url, saving it to the location `path`, or if not specified, a temporary path. Returns the path of the downloaded file.

!!! note
    Since Julia 1.6, this function is deprecated and is just a thin wrapper around `Downloads.download`. In new code, you should use that function directly instead of calling this.
