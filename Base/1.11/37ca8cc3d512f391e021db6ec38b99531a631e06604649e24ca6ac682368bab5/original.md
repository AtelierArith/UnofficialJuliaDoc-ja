```
Base.identify_package(name::String)::Union{PkgId, Nothing}
Base.identify_package(where::Union{Module,PkgId}, name::String)::Union{PkgId, Nothing}
```

Identify the package by its name from the current environment stack, returning its `PkgId`, or `nothing` if it cannot be found.

If only the `name` argument is provided, it searches each environment in the stack and its named direct dependencies.

The `where` argument provides the context from where to search for the package: in this case it first checks if the name matches the context itself, otherwise it searches all recursive dependencies (from the resolved manifest of each environment) until it locates the context `where`, and from there identifies the dependency with the corresponding name.

```julia-repl
julia> Base.identify_package("Pkg") # Pkg is a dependency of the default environment
Pkg [44cfe95a-1eb2-52ea-b672-e2afdf69b78f]

julia> using LinearAlgebra

julia> Base.identify_package(LinearAlgebra, "Pkg") # Pkg is not a dependency of LinearAlgebra
```
