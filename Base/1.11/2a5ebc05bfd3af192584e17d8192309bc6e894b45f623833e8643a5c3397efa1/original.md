```
mod(x, y)
rem(x, y, RoundDown)
```

The reduction of `x` modulo `y`, or equivalently, the remainder of `x` after floored division by `y`, i.e. `x - y*fld(x,y)` if computed without intermediate rounding.

The result will have the same sign as `y`, and magnitude less than `abs(y)` (with some exceptions, see note below).

!!! note
    When used with floating point values, the exact result may not be representable by the type, and so rounding error may occur. In particular, if the exact result is very close to `y`, then it may be rounded to `y`.
