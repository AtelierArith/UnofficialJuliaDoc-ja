```
push!(collection, items...) -> collection
```

Insert one or more `items` in `collection`. If `collection` is an ordered container, the items are inserted at the end (in the given order).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> push!([1, 2, 3], 4, 5, 6)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```

If `collection` is ordered, use [`append!`](@ref) to add all the elements of another collection to it. The result of the preceding example is equivalent to `append!([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`. For `AbstractSet` objects, [`union!`](@ref) can be used instead.

See [`sizehint!`](@ref) for notes about the performance model.

See also [`pushfirst!`](@ref).
