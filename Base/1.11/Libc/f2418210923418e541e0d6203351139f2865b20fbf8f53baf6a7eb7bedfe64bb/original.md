```
errno([code])
```

Get the value of the C library's `errno`. If an argument is specified, it is used to set the value of `errno`.

The value of `errno` is only valid immediately after a `ccall` to a C library routine that sets it. Specifically, you cannot call `errno` at the next prompt in a REPL, because lots of code is executed between prompts.
