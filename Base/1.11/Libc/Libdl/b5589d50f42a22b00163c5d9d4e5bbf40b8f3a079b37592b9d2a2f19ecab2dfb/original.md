```
dlsym(handle, sym; throw_error::Bool = true)
```

Look up a symbol from a shared library handle, return callable function pointer on success.

If the symbol cannot be found, this method throws an error, unless the keyword argument `throw_error` is set to `false`, in which case this method returns `nothing`.
