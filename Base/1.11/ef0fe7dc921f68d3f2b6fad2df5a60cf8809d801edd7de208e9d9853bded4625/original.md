```
keys(m::RegexMatch) -> Vector
```

Return a vector of keys for all capture groups of the underlying regex. A key is included even if the capture group fails to match. That is, `idx` will be in the return value even if `m[idx] == nothing`.

Unnamed capture groups will have integer keys corresponding to their index. Named capture groups will have string keys.
