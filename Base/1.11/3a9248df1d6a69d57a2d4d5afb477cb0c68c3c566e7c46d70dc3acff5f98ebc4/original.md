```
Colon()
```

Colons (:) are used to signify indexing entire objects or dimensions at once.

Very few operations are defined on Colons directly; instead they are converted by [`to_indices`](@ref) to an internal vector type (`Base.Slice`) to represent the collection of indices they span before being used.

The singleton instance of `Colon` is also a function used to construct ranges; see [`:`](@ref).
