```
@cfunction(callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> Ptr{Cvoid}
@cfunction($callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> CFunction
```

Generate a C-callable function pointer from the Julia function `callable` for the given type signature. To pass the return value to a `ccall`, use the argument type `Ptr{Cvoid}` in the signature.

Note that the argument type tuple must be a literal tuple, and not a tuple-valued variable or expression (although it can include a splat expression). And that these arguments will be evaluated in global scope during compile-time (not deferred until runtime). Adding a '$' in front of the function argument changes this to instead create a runtime closure over the local variable `callable` (this is not supported on all architectures).

See [manual section on ccall and cfunction usage](@ref Calling-C-and-Fortran-Code).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> function foo(x::Int, y::Int)
           return x + y
       end

julia> @cfunction(foo, Int, (Int, Int))
Ptr{Cvoid} @0x000000001b82fcd0
```
