```
parent(A)
```

Return the underlying parent object of the view. This parent of objects of types `SubArray`, `SubString`, `ReshapedArray` or `LinearAlgebra.Transpose` is what was passed as an argument to `view`, `reshape`, `transpose`, etc. during object creation. If the input is not a wrapped object, return the input itself. If the input is wrapped multiple times, only the outermost wrapper will be removed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> V = view(A, 1:2, :)
2×2 view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1:2, :) with eltype Int64:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> parent(V)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
