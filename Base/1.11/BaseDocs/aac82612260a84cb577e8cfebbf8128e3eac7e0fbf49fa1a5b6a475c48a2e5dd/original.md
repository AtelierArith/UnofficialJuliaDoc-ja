```
__init__
```

The `__init__()` function in a module executes immediately *after* the module is loaded at runtime for the first time. It is called once, after all other statements in the module have been executed. Because it is called after fully importing the module, `__init__` functions of submodules will be executed first. Two typical uses of `__init__` are calling runtime initialization functions of external C libraries and initializing global constants that involve pointers returned by external libraries. See the [manual section about modules](@ref modules) for more details.

# Examples

```julia
const foo_data_ptr = Ref{Ptr{Cvoid}}(0)
function __init__()
    ccall((:foo_init, :libfoo), Cvoid, ())
    foo_data_ptr[] = ccall((:foo_data, :libfoo), Ptr{Cvoid}, ())
    nothing
end
```
