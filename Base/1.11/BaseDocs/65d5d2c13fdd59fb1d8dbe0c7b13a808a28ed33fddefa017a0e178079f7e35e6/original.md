primitive type
```

`primitive type` declares a concrete type whose data consists only of a series of bits. Classic examples of primitive types are integers and floating-point values. Some example built-in primitive type declarations:

```julia
primitive type Char 32 end
primitive type Bool <: Integer 8 end
```

The number after the name indicates how many bits of storage the type requires. Currently, only sizes that are multiples of 8 bits are supported. The [`Bool`](@ref) declaration shows how a primitive type can be optionally declared to be a subtype of some supertype.
