```
Expr(head::Symbol, args...)
```

A type representing compound expressions in parsed julia code (ASTs). Each expression consists of a `head` `Symbol` identifying which kind of expression it is (e.g. a call, for loop, conditional statement, etc.), and subexpressions (e.g. the arguments of a call). The subexpressions are stored in a `Vector{Any}` field called `args`.

See the manual chapter on [Metaprogramming](@ref) and the developer documentation [Julia ASTs](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Expr(:call, :+, 1, 2)
:(1 + 2)

julia> dump(:(a ? b : c))
Expr
  head: Symbol if
  args: Array{Any}((3,))
    1: Symbol a
    2: Symbol b
    3: Symbol c
```
