abstract type
```

`abstract type` declares a type that cannot be instantiated, and serves only as a node in the type graph, thereby describing sets of related concrete types: those concrete types which are their descendants. Abstract types form the conceptual hierarchy which makes Juliaâ€™s type system more than just a collection of object implementations. For example:

```julia
abstract type Number end
abstract type Real <: Number end
```

[`Number`](@ref) has no supertype, whereas [`Real`](@ref) is an abstract subtype of `Number`.
