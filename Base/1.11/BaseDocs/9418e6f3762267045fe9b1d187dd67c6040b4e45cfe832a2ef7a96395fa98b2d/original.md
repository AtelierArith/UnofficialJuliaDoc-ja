```
replacefield!(value, name::Symbol, expected, desired,
              [success_order::Symbol, [fail_order::Symbol=success_order]) -> (; old, success::Bool)
replacefield!(value, i::Int, expected, desired,
              [success_order::Symbol, [fail_order::Symbol=success_order]) -> (; old, success::Bool)
```

Atomically perform the operations to get and conditionally set a field to a given value.

```
y = getfield(value, name, fail_order)
ok = y === expected
if ok
    setfield!(value, name, desired, success_order)
end
return (; old = y, success = ok)
```

If supported by the hardware, this may be optimized to the appropriate hardware instruction, otherwise it'll use a loop.
