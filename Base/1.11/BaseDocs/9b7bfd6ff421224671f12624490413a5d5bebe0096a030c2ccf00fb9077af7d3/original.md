macro
```

`macro` defines a method for inserting generated code into a program. A macro maps a sequence of argument expressions to a returned expression, and the resulting expression is substituted directly into the program at the point where the macro is invoked. Macros are a way to run generated code without calling [`eval`](@ref Main.eval), since the generated code instead simply becomes part of the surrounding program. Macro arguments may include expressions, literal values, and symbols. Macros can be defined for variable number of arguments (varargs), but do not accept keyword arguments. Every macro also implicitly gets passed the arguments `__source__`, which contains the line number and file name the macro is called from, and `__module__`, which is the module the macro is expanded in.

See the manual section on [Metaprogramming](@ref) for more information about how to write a macro.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> macro sayhello(name)
           return :( println("Hello, ", $name, "!") )
       end
@sayhello (macro with 1 method)

julia> @sayhello "Charlie"
Hello, Charlie!

julia> macro saylots(x...)
           return :( println("Say: ", $(x...)) )
       end
@saylots (macro with 1 method)

julia> @saylots "hey " "there " "friend"
Say: hey there friend
```
