```
apropos([io::IO=stdout], pattern::Union{AbstractString,Regex})
```

Search available docstrings for entries containing `pattern`.

When `pattern` is a string, case is ignored. Results are printed to `io`.

`apropos` can be called from the help mode in the REPL by wrapping the query in double quotes:

```
help?> "pattern"
```
