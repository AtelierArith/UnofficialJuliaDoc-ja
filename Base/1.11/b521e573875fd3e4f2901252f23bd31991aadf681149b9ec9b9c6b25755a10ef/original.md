```
count(
    pattern::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString,AbstractPattern},
    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return the number of matches for `pattern` in `string`. This is equivalent to calling `length(findall(pattern, string))` but more efficient.

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a character as the pattern requires at least Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count('a', "JuliaLang")
2

julia> count(r"a(.)a", "cabacabac", overlap=true)
3

julia> count(r"a(.)a", "cabacabac")
2
```
