```
redisplay(x)
redisplay(d::AbstractDisplay, x)
redisplay(mime, x)
redisplay(d::AbstractDisplay, mime, x)
```

By default, the `redisplay` functions simply call [`display`](@ref). However, some display backends may override `redisplay` to modify an existing display of `x` (if any). Using `redisplay` is also a hint to the backend that `x` may be redisplayed several times, and the backend may choose to defer the display until (for example) the next interactive prompt.
