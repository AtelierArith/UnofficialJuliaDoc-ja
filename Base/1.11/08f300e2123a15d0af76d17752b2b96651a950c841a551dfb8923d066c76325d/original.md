```
codeunit(s::AbstractString) -> Type{<:Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}}
```

Return the code unit type of the given string object. For ASCII, Latin-1, or UTF-8 encoded strings, this would be `UInt8`; for UCS-2 and UTF-16 it would be `UInt16`; for UTF-32 it would be `UInt32`. The code unit type need not be limited to these three types, but it's hard to think of widely used string encodings that don't use one of these units. `codeunit(s)` is the same as `typeof(codeunit(s,1))` when `s` is a non-empty string.
