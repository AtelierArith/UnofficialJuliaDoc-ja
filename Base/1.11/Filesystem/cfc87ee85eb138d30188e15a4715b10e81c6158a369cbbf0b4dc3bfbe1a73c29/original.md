```
symlink(target::AbstractString, link::AbstractString; dir_target = false)
```

Creates a symbolic link to `target` with the name `link`.

On Windows, symlinks must be explicitly declared as referring to a directory or not.  If `target` already exists, by default the type of `link` will be auto- detected, however if `target` does not exist, this function defaults to creating a file symlink unless `dir_target` is set to `true`.  Note that if the user sets `dir_target` but `target` exists and is a file, a directory symlink will still be created, but dereferencing the symlink will fail, just as if the user creates a file symlink (by calling `symlink()` with `dir_target` set to `false` before the directory is created) and tries to dereference it to a directory.

Additionally, there are two methods of making a link on Windows; symbolic links and junction points.  Junction points are slightly more efficient, but do not support relative paths, so if a relative directory symlink is requested (as denoted by `isabspath(target)` returning `false`) a symlink will be used, else a junction point will be used.  Best practice for creating symlinks on Windows is to create them only after the files/directories they reference are already created.

!!! note
    This function raises an error under operating systems that do not support soft symbolic links, such as Windows XP.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    The `dir_target` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.6.  Prior to this, symlinks to nonexistent paths on windows would always be file symlinks, and relative symlinks to directories were not supported.
