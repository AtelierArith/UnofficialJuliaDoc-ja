```
iswritable(path::String)
```

Return `true` if the access permissions for the given `path` permitted writing by the current user.

!!! note
    This permission may change before the user calls `open`, so it is recommended to just call `open` alone and handle the error if that fails, rather than calling `iswritable` first.


!!! note
    Currently this function does not correctly interrogate filesystem ACLs on Windows, therefore it can return wrong results.


!!! compat "Julia 1.11"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.11.
