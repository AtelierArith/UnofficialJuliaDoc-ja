```
digits!(array, n::Integer; base::Integer = 10)
```

Fills an array of the digits of `n` in the given base. More significant digits are at higher indices. If the array length is insufficient, the least significant digits are filled up to the array length. If the array length is excessive, the excess portion is filled with zeros.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> digits!([2, 2, 2, 2], 10, base = 2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 0

julia> digits!([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 10, base = 2)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
