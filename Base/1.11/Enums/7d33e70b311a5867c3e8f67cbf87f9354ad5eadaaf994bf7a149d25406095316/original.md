```
@enum EnumName[::BaseType] value1[=x] value2[=y]
```

Create an `Enum{BaseType}` subtype with name `EnumName` and enum member values of `value1` and `value2` with optional assigned values of `x` and `y`, respectively. `EnumName` can be used just like other types and enum member values as regular values, such as

# Examples

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> @enum Fruit apple=1 orange=2 kiwi=3

julia> f(x::Fruit) = "I'm a Fruit with value: $(Int(x))"
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(apple)
"I'm a Fruit with value: 1"

julia> Fruit(1)
apple::Fruit = 1
```

Values can also be specified inside a `begin` block, e.g.

```julia
@enum EnumName begin
    value1
    value2
end
```

`BaseType`, which defaults to [`Int32`](@ref), must be a primitive subtype of `Integer`. Member values can be converted between the enum type and `BaseType`. `read` and `write` perform these conversions automatically. In case the enum is created with a non-default `BaseType`, `Integer(value1)` will return the integer `value1` with the type `BaseType`.

To list all the instances of an enum use `instances`, e.g.

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> instances(Fruit)
(apple, orange, kiwi)
```

It is possible to construct a symbol from an enum instance:

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> Symbol(apple)
:apple
```
