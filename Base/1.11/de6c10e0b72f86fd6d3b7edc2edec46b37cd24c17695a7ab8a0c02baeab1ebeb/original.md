```
write(io::IO, x)
```

Write the canonical binary representation of a value to the given I/O stream or file. Return the number of bytes written into the stream. See also [`print`](@ref) to write a text representation (with an encoding that may depend upon `io`).

The endianness of the written value depends on the endianness of the host system. Convert to/from a fixed endianness when writing/reading (e.g. using  [`htol`](@ref) and [`ltoh`](@ref)) to get results that are consistent across platforms.

You can write multiple values with the same `write` call. i.e. the following are equivalent:

```
write(io, x, y...)
write(io, x) + write(io, y...)
```

# Examples

Consistent serialization:

```jldoctest
julia> fname = tempname(); # random temporary filename

julia> open(fname,"w") do f
           # Make sure we write 64bit integer in little-endian byte order
           write(f,htol(Int64(42)))
       end
8

julia> open(fname,"r") do f
           # Convert back to host byte order and host integer type
           Int(ltoh(read(f,Int64)))
       end
42
```

Merging write calls:

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.", " It has many members.")
56

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members."

julia> write(io, "Sometimes those members") + write(io, " write documentation.")
44

julia> String(take!(io))
"Sometimes those members write documentation."
```

User-defined plain-data types without `write` methods can be written when wrapped in a `Ref`:

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyStruct; x::Float64; end

julia> io = IOBuffer()
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=true, seekable=true, append=false, size=0, maxsize=Inf, ptr=1, mark=-1)

julia> write(io, Ref(MyStruct(42.0)))
8

julia> seekstart(io); read!(io, Ref(MyStruct(NaN)))
Base.RefValue{MyStruct}(MyStruct(42.0))
```
