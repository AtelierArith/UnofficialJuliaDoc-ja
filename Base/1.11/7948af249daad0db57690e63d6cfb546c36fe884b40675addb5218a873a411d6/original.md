```
unsafe_load(p::Ptr{T}, i::Integer=1)
unsafe_load(p::Ptr{T}, order::Symbol)
unsafe_load(p::Ptr{T}, i::Integer, order::Symbol)
```

Load a value of type `T` from the address of the `i`th element (1-indexed) starting at `p`. This is equivalent to the C expression `p[i-1]`. Optionally, an atomic memory ordering can be provided.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer `p` to ensure that it is valid. Like C, the programmer is responsible for ensuring that referenced memory is not freed or garbage collected while invoking this function. Incorrect usage may segfault your program or return garbage answers. Unlike C, dereferencing memory region allocated as different type may be valid provided that the types are compatible.

!!! compat "Julia 1.10"
    The `order` argument is available as of Julia 1.10.
