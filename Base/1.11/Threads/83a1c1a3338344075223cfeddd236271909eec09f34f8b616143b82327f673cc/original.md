```
Threads.atomic_and!(x::Atomic{T}, val::T) where T
```

Atomically bitwise-and `x` with `val`

Performs `x[] &= val` atomically. Returns the **old** value.

For further details, see LLVM's `atomicrmw and` instruction.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = Threads.Atomic{Int}(3)
Base.Threads.Atomic{Int64}(3)

julia> Threads.atomic_and!(x, 2)
3

julia> x[]
2
```
