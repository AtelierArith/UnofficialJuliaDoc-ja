```
Threads.atomic_min!(x::Atomic{T}, val::T) where T
```

Atomically store the minimum of `x` and `val` in `x`

Performs `x[] = min(x[], val)` atomically. Returns the **old** value.

For further details, see LLVM's `atomicrmw min` instruction.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = Threads.Atomic{Int}(7)
Base.Threads.Atomic{Int64}(7)

julia> Threads.atomic_min!(x, 5)
7

julia> x[]
5
```
