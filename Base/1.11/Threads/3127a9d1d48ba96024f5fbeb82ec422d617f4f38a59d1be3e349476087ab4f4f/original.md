```
Threads.atomic_add!(x::Atomic{T}, val::T) where T <: ArithmeticTypes
```

Atomically add `val` to `x`

Performs `x[] += val` atomically. Returns the **old** value. Not defined for `Atomic{Bool}`.

For further details, see LLVM's `atomicrmw add` instruction.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = Threads.Atomic{Int}(3)
Base.Threads.Atomic{Int64}(3)

julia> Threads.atomic_add!(x, 2)
3

julia> x[]
