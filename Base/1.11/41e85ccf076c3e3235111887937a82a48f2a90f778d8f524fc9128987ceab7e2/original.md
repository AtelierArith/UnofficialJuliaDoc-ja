```
merge(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. If the same key is present in another collection, the value for that key will be the value it has in the last collection listed. See also [`mergewith`](@ref) for custom handling of values with the same key.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict("foo" => 0.0, "bar" => 42.0)
Dict{String, Float64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "foo" => 0.0

julia> b = Dict("baz" => 17, "bar" => 4711)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 4711
  "baz" => 17

julia> merge(a, b)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 4711.0
  "baz" => 17.0
  "foo" => 0.0

julia> merge(b, a)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "baz" => 17.0
  "foo" => 0.0
```
