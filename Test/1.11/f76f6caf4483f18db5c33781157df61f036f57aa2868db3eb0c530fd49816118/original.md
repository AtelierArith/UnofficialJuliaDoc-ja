```
@testset [CustomTestSet] [options...] ["description"] begin test_ex end
@testset [CustomTestSet] [options...] ["description $v"] for v in itr test_ex end
@testset [CustomTestSet] [options...] ["description $v, $w"] for v in itrv, w in itrw test_ex end

```

# With begin/end or function call

When @testset is used, with begin/end or a single function call, the macro starts a new test set in which to evaluate the given expression.

If no custom testset type is given it defaults to creating a `DefaultTestSet`. `DefaultTestSet` records all the results and, if there are any `Fail`s or `Error`s, throws an exception at the end of the top-level (non-nested) test set, along with a summary of the test results.

Any custom testset type (subtype of `AbstractTestSet`) can be given and it will also be used for any nested `@testset` invocations. The given options are only applied to the test set where they are given. The default test set type accepts three boolean options:

  * `verbose`: if `true`, the result summary of the nested testsets is shown even when they all pass (the default is `false`).
  * `showtiming`: if `true`, the duration of each displayed testset is shown (the default is `true`).
  * `failfast`: if `true`, any test failure or error will cause the testset and any child testsets to return immediately (the default is `false`). This can also be set globally via the env var `JULIA_TEST_FAILFAST`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    `@testset test_func()` requires at least Julia 1.8.


!!! compat "Julia 1.9"
    `failfast` requires at least Julia 1.9.


The description string accepts interpolation from the loop indices. If no description is provided, one is constructed based on the variables. If a function call is provided, its name will be used. Explicit description strings override this behavior.

By default the `@testset` macro will return the testset object itself, though this behavior can be customized in other testset types. If a `for` loop is used then the macro collects and returns a list of the return values of the `finish` method, which by default will return a list of the testset objects used in each iteration.

Before the execution of the body of a `@testset`, there is an implicit call to `Random.seed!(seed)` where `seed` is the current seed of the global RNG. Moreover, after the execution of the body, the state of the global RNG is restored to what it was before the `@testset`. This is meant to ease reproducibility in case of failure, and to allow seamless re-arrangements of `@testset`s regardless of their side-effect on the global RNG state.

## Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"trigonometric identities |    4      4  [0-9\.]+s"
julia> @testset "trigonometric identities" begin
           θ = 2/3*π
           @test sin(-θ) ≈ -sin(θ)
           @test cos(-θ) ≈ cos(θ)
           @test sin(2θ) ≈ 2*sin(θ)*cos(θ)
           @test cos(2θ) ≈ cos(θ)^2 - sin(θ)^2
       end;
Test Summary:            | Pass  Total  Time
trigonometric identities |    4      4  0.2s
```

# `@testset for`

When `@testset for` is used, the macro starts a new test for each iteration of the provided loop. The semantics of each test set are otherwise identical to that of that `begin/end` case (as if used for each loop iteration).

# `@testset let`

When `@testset let` is used, the macro starts a *transparent* test set with the given object added as a context object to any failing test contained therein. This is useful when performing a set of related tests on one larger object and it is desirable to print this larger object when any of the individual tests fail. Transparent test sets do not introduce additional levels of nesting in the test set hierarchy and are passed through directly to the parent test set (with the context object appended to any failing tests.)

!!! compat "Julia 1.9"
    `@testset let` requires at least Julia 1.9.


!!! compat "Julia 1.10"
    Multiple `let` assignments are supported since Julia 1.10.

```jldoctest
julia> @testset let logi = log(im)
           @test imag(logi) == π/2
           @test !iszero(real(logi))
       end

  Expression: !(iszero(real(logi)))
     Context: logi = 0.0 + 1.5707963267948966im

julia> @testset let logi = log(im), op = !iszero
