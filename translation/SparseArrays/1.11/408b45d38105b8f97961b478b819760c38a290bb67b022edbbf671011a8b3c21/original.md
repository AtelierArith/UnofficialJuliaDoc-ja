```
blockdiag(A...)
```

Concatenate matrices block-diagonally. Currently only implemented for sparse matrices.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> blockdiag(sparse(2I, 3, 3), sparse(4I, 2, 2))
5×5 SparseMatrixCSC{Int64, Int64} with 5 stored entries:
 2  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  2  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  2  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  4  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  4
```
