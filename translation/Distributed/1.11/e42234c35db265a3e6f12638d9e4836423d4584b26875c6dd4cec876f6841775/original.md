```
manage(manager::ClusterManager, id::Integer, config::WorkerConfig. op::Symbol)
```

Implemented by cluster managers. It is called on the master process, during a worker's lifetime, with appropriate `op` values:

  * with `:register`/`:deregister` when a worker is added / removed from the Julia worker pool.
  * with `:interrupt` when `interrupt(workers)` is called. The `ClusterManager` should signal the appropriate worker with an interrupt signal.
  * with `:finalize` for cleanup purposes.
