```
@distributed
```

A distributed memory, parallel for loop of the form :

```
@distributed [reducer] for var = range
    body
end
```

The specified range is partitioned and locally executed across all workers. In case an optional reducer function is specified, `@distributed` performs local reductions on each worker with a final reduction on the calling process.

Note that without a reducer function, `@distributed` executes asynchronously, i.e. it spawns independent tasks on all available workers and returns immediately without waiting for completion. To wait for completion, prefix the call with [`@sync`](@ref), like :

```
@sync @distributed for var = range
    body
end
```
