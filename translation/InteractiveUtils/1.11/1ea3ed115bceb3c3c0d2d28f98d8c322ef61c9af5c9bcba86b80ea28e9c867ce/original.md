```
code_warntype([io::IO], f, types; debuginfo=:default)
```

Prints lowered and type-inferred ASTs for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature to `io` which defaults to `stdout`. The ASTs are annotated in such a way as to cause "non-leaf" types which may be problematic for performance to be emphasized (if color is available, displayed in red). This serves as a warning of potential type instability.

Not all non-leaf types are particularly problematic for performance, and the performance characteristics of a particular type is an implementation detail of the compiler. `code_warntype` will err on the side of coloring types red if they might be a performance concern, so some types may be colored red even if they do not impact performance. Small unions of concrete types are usually not a concern, so these are highlighted in yellow.

Keyword argument `debuginfo` may be one of `:source` or `:none` (default), to specify the verbosity of code comments.

See the [`@code_warntype`](@ref man-code-warntype) section in the Performance Tips page of the manual for more information.
