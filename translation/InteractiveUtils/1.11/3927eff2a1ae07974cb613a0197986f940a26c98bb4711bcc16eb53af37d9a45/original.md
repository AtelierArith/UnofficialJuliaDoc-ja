```
@time_imports
```

A macro to execute an expression and produce a report of any time spent importing packages and their dependencies. Any compilation time will be reported as a percentage, and how much of which was recompilation, if any.

One line is printed per package or package extension. The duration shown is the time to import that package itself, not including the time to load any of its dependencies.

On Julia 1.9+ [package extensions](@ref man-extensions) will show as Parent â†’ Extension.

!!! note
    During the load process a package sequentially imports all of its dependencies, not just its direct dependencies.
