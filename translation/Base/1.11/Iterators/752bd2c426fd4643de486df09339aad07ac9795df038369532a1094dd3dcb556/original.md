```
enumerate(iter)
```

An iterator that yields `(i, x)` where `i` is a counter starting at 1, and `x` is the `i`th value from the given iterator. It's useful when you need not only the values `x` over which you are iterating, but also the number of iterations so far.

Note that `i` may not be valid for indexing `iter`, or may index a different element. This will happen if `iter` has indices that do not start at 1, and may happen for strings, dictionaries, etc. See the `pairs(IndexLinear(), iter)` method if you want to ensure that `i` is an index.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ["a", "b", "c"];

julia> for (index, value) in enumerate(a)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c

julia> str = "na誰ve";

julia> for (i, val) in enumerate(str)
           print("i = ", i, ", val = ", val, ", ")
           try @show(str[i]) catch e println(e) end
       end
i = 1, val = n, str[i] = 'n'
i = 2, val = a, str[i] = 'a'
i = 3, val = 誰, str[i] = '誰'
i = 4, val = v, StringIndexError("na誰ve", 4)
i = 5, val = e, str[i] = 'v'
```
