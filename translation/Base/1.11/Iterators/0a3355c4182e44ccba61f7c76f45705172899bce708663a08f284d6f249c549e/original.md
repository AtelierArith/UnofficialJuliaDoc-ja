```
zip(iters...)
```

Run multiple iterators at the same time, until any of them is exhausted. The value type of the `zip` iterator is a tuple of values of its subiterators.

!!! note
    `zip` orders the calls to its subiterators in such a way that stateful iterators will not advance when another iterator finishes in the current iteration.


!!! note
    `zip()` with no arguments yields an infinite iterator of empty tuples.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:5
1:5

julia> b = ["e","d","b","c","a"]
5-element Vector{String}:
 "e"
 "d"
 "b"
 "c"
 "a"

julia> c = zip(a,b)
zip(1:5, ["e", "d", "b", "c", "a"])

julia> length(c)
5

julia> first(c)
(1, "e")
```
