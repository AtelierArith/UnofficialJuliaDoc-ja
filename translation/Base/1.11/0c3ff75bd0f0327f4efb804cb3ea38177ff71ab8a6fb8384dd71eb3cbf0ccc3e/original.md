```
findnext(A, i)
```

Find the next index after or including `i` of a `true` element of `A`, or `nothing` if not found.

Indices are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [false, false, true, false]
4-element Vector{Bool}:
 0
 0
 1
 0

julia> findnext(A, 1)
3

julia> findnext(A, 4) # returns nothing, but not printed in the REPL

julia> A = [false false; true false]
2Ã—2 Matrix{Bool}:
 0  0
 1  0

julia> findnext(A, CartesianIndex(1, 1))
CartesianIndex(2, 1)
```
