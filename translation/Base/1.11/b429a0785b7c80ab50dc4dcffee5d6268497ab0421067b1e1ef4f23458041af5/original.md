```
CompositeException
```

Wrap a `Vector` of exceptions thrown by a [`Task`](@ref) (e.g. generated from a remote worker over a channel or an asynchronously executing local I/O write or a remote worker under `pmap`) with information about the series of exceptions. For example, if a group of workers are executing several tasks, and multiple workers fail, the resulting `CompositeException` will contain a "bundle" of information from each worker indicating where and why the exception(s) occurred.
