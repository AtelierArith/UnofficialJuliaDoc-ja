```
BigInt(x)
```

Create an arbitrary precision integer. `x` may be an `Int` (or anything that can be converted to an `Int`). The usual mathematical operators are defined for this type, and results are promoted to a [`BigInt`](@ref).

Instances can be constructed from strings via [`parse`](@ref), or using the `big` string literal.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parse(BigInt, "42")
42

julia> big"313"
313

julia> BigInt(10)^19
10000000000000000000
```
