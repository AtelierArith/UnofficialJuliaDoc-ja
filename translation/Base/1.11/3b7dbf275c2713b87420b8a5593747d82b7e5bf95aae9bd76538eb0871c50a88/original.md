```
findmax(f, domain) -> (f(x), index)
```

Return a pair of a value in the codomain (outputs of `f`) and the index or key of the corresponding value in the `domain` (inputs to `f`) such that `f(x)` is maximised. If there are multiple maximal points, then the first one will be returned.

`domain` must be a non-empty iterable supporting [`keys`](@ref). Indices are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(domain)`](@ref).

Values are compared with `isless`.

julia> findmax(first, [(1, :a), (3, :b), (3, :c)])
(3, 2)

julia> findmax(cos, 0:π/2:2π)
(1.0, 1)
