```
deepcopy(x)
```

Create a deep copy of `x`: everything is copied recursively, resulting in a fully independent object. For example, deep-copying an array creates deep copies of all the objects it contains and produces a new array with the consistent relationship structure (e.g., if the first two elements are the same object in the original array, the first two elements of the new array will also be the same `deepcopy`ed object). Calling `deepcopy` on an object should generally have the same effect as serializing and then deserializing it.

While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override the default `deepcopy` behavior by defining a specialized version of the function `deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::IdDict)` (which shouldn't otherwise be used), where `T` is the type to be specialized for, and `dict` keeps track of objects copied so far within the recursion. Within the definition, `deepcopy_internal` should be used in place of `deepcopy`, and the `dict` variable should be updated as appropriate before returning.
