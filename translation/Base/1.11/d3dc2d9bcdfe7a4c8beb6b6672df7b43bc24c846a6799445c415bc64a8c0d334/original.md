```
readbytes!(stream::IOStream, b::AbstractVector{UInt8}, nb=length(b); all::Bool=true)
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `stream` into `b`, returning the number of bytes read. The size of `b` will be increased if needed (i.e. if `nb` is greater than `length(b)` and enough bytes could be read), but it will never be decreased.

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.
