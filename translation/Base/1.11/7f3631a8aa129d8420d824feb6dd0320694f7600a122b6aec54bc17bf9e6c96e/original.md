```
open(fd::OS_HANDLE) -> IO
```

Take a raw file descriptor wrap it in a Julia-aware IO type, and take ownership of the fd handle. Call `open(Libc.dup(fd))` to avoid the ownership capture of the original handle.

!!! warning
    Do not call this on a handle that's already owned by some other part of the system.
