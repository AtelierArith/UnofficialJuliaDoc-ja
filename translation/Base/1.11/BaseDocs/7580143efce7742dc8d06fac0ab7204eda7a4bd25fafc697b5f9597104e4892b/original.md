```
const
```

`const` is used to declare global variables whose values will not change. In almost all code (and particularly performance sensitive code) global variables should be declared constant in this way.

```julia
const x = 5
```

Multiple variables can be declared within a single `const`:

```julia
const y, z = 7, 11
```

Note that `const` only applies to one `=` operation, therefore `const x = y = 1` declares `x` to be constant but not `y`. On the other hand, `const x = const y = 1` declares both `x` and `y` constant.

Note that "constant-ness" does not extend into mutable containers; only the association between a variable and its value is constant. If `x` is an array or dictionary (for example) you can still modify, add, or remove elements.

In some cases changing the value of a `const` variable gives a warning instead of an error. However, this can produce unpredictable behavior or corrupt the state of your program, and so should be avoided. This feature is intended only for convenience during interactive use.
