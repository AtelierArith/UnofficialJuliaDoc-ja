```
setfield!(value, name::Symbol, x, [order::Symbol])
setfield!(value, i::Int, x, [order::Symbol])
```

Assign `x` to a named field in `value` of composite type. The `value` must be mutable and `x` must be a subtype of `fieldtype(typeof(value), name)`. Additionally, an ordering can be specified for this operation. If the field was declared `@atomic`, this specification is mandatory. Otherwise, if not declared as `@atomic`, it must be `:not_atomic` if specified. See also [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mutable struct MyMutableStruct
           field::Int
       end

julia> a = MyMutableStruct(1);

julia> setfield!(a, :field, 2);

julia> getfield(a, :field)
2

julia> a = 1//2
1//2

julia> setfield!(a, :num, 3);
ERROR: setfield!: immutable struct of type Rational cannot be changed
