```
Symbol
```

The type of object used to represent identifiers in parsed julia code (ASTs). Also often used as a name or label to identify an entity (e.g. as a dictionary key). `Symbol`s can be entered using the `:` quote operator:

```jldoctest
julia> :name
:name

julia> typeof(:name)
Symbol

julia> x = 42
42

julia> eval(:x)
42
```

`Symbol`s can also be constructed from strings or other values by calling the constructor `Symbol(x...)`.

`Symbol`s are immutable and their implementation re-uses the same object for all `Symbol`s with the same name.

Unlike strings, `Symbol`s are "atomic" or "scalar" entities that do not support iteration over characters.
