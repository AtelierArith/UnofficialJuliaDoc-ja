```
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k; by=identity, lt=isless, rev=false)
```

Like [`partialsortperm`](@ref), but accepts a preallocated index vector `ix` the same size as `v`, which is used to store (a permutation of) the indices of `v`.

`ix` is initialized to contain the indices of `v`.

(Typically, the indices of `v` will be `1:length(v)`, although if `v` has an alternative array type with non-one-based indices, such as an `OffsetArray`, `ix` must share those same indices)

Upon return, `ix` is guaranteed to have the indices `k` in their sorted positions, such that

```julia
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k);
v[ix[k]] == partialsort(v, k)
```

The return value is the `k`th element of `ix` if `k` is an integer, or view into `ix` if `k` is a range.

!!! warning
    Behavior can be unexpected when any mutated argument shares memory with any other argument.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> ix = Vector{Int}(undef, 4);

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 1)
2

julia> ix = [1:4;];

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 2:3)
2-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 2:3) with eltype Int64:
 4
 3
```

```

```
