```
sort!(v; alg::Algorithm=defalg(v), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort the vector `v` in place. A stable algorithm is used by default: the ordering of elements that compare equal is preserved. A specific algorithm can be selected via the `alg` keyword (see [Sorting Algorithms](@ref) for available algorithms).

Elements are first transformed with the function `by` and then compared according to either the function `lt` or the ordering `order`. Finally, the resulting order is reversed if `rev=true` (this preserves forward stability: elements that compare equal are not reversed). The current implementation applies the `by` transformation before each comparison rather than once per element.

Passing an `lt` other than `isless` along with an `order` other than [`Base.Order.Forward`](@ref) or [`Base.Order.Reverse`](@ref) is not permitted, otherwise all options are independent and can be used together in all possible combinations. Note that `order` can also include a "by" transformation, in which case it is applied after that defined with the `by` keyword. For more information on `order` values see the documentation on [Alternate Orderings](@ref).

Relations between two elements are defined as follows (with "less" and "greater" exchanged when `rev=true`):

  * `x` is less than `y` if `lt(by(x), by(y))` (or `Base.Order.lt(order, by(x), by(y))`) yields true.
  * `x` is greater than `y` if `y` is less than `x`.
  * `x` and `y` are equivalent if neither is less than the other ("incomparable" is sometimes used as a synonym for "equivalent").

The result of `sort!` is sorted in the sense that every element is greater than or equivalent to the previous one.

The `lt` function must define a strict weak order, that is, it must be

  * irreflexive: `lt(x, x)` always yields `false`,
  * asymmetric: if `lt(x, y)` yields `true` then `lt(y, x)` yields `false`,
  * transitive: `lt(x, y) && lt(y, z)` implies `lt(x, z)`,
  * transitive in equivalence: `!lt(x, y) && !lt(y, x)` and `!lt(y, z) && !lt(z, y)` together imply `!lt(x, z) && !lt(z, x)`. In words: if `x` and `y` are equivalent and `y` and `z` are equivalent then `x` and `z` must be equivalent.

For example `<` is a valid `lt` function for `Int` values but `â‰¤` is not: it violates irreflexivity. For `Float64` values even `<` is invalid as it violates the fourth condition: `1.0` and `NaN` are equivalent and so are `NaN` and `2.0` but `1.0` and `2.0` are not equivalent.
