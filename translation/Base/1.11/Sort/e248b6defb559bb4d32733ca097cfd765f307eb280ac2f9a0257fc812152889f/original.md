QuickSort
```

Indicate that a sorting function should use the quick sort algorithm, which is *not* stable.

Characteristics:

  * *not stable*: does not preserve the ordering of elements that compare equal (e.g. "a" and "A" in a sort of letters that ignores case).
  * *in-place* in memory.
  * *divide-and-conquer*: sort strategy similar to [`MergeSort`](@ref).
  * *good performance* for large collections.
