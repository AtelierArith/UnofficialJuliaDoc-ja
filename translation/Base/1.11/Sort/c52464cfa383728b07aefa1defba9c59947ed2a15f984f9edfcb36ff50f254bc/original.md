InsertionSort
```

Use the insertion sort algorithm.

Insertion sort traverses the collection one element at a time, inserting each element into its correct, sorted position in the output vector.

Characteristics:

  * *stable*: preserves the ordering of elements that compare equal

(e.g. "a" and "A" in a sort of letters that ignores case).

  * *in-place* in memory.
  * *quadratic performance* in the number of elements to be sorted:

it is well-suited to small collections but should not be used for large ones.
