```
inv(x)
```

Return the multiplicative inverse of `x`, such that `x*inv(x)` or `inv(x)*x` yields [`one(x)`](@ref) (the multiplicative identity) up to roundoff errors.

If `x` is a number, this is essentially the same as `one(x)/x`, but for some types `inv(x)` may be slightly more efficient.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> inv(2)
0.5

julia> inv(1 + 2im)
0.2 - 0.4im

julia> inv(1 + 2im) * (1 + 2im)
1.0 + 0.0im

julia> inv(2//3)
3//2
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `inv(::Missing)` requires at least Julia 1.2.
