```
read(io::IO, T)
```

Read a single value of type `T` from `io`, in canonical binary representation.

Note that Julia does not convert the endianness for you. Use [`ntoh`](@ref) or [`ltoh`](@ref) for this purpose.

```
read(io::IO, String)
```

Read the entirety of `io`, as a `String` (see also [`readchomp`](@ref)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> read(io, Char)
'J': ASCII/Unicode U+004A (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> read(io, String)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization"
```
