```
dropdims(A; dims)
```

Return an array with the same data as `A`, but with the dimensions specified by `dims` removed. `size(A,d)` must equal 1 for every `d` in `dims`, and repeated dimensions or numbers outside `1:ndims(A)` are forbidden.

The result shares the same underlying data as `A`, such that the result is mutable if and only if `A` is mutable, and setting elements of one alters the values of the other.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:4),(2,2,1,1))
2×2×1×1 Array{Int64, 4}:
[:, :, 1, 1] =
 1  3
 2  4

julia> b = dropdims(a; dims=3)
2×2×1 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  3
 2  4

julia> b[1,1,1] = 5; a
2×2×1×1 Array{Int64, 4}:
[:, :, 1, 1] =
 5  3
 2  4
```
