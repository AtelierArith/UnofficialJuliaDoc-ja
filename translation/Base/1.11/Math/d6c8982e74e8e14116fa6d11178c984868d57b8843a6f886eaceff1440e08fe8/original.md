```
log(b,x)
```

Compute the base `b` logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> log(4,8)
1.5

julia> log(4,2)
0.5

julia> log(-2, 3)
ERROR: DomainError with -2.0:
log was called with a negative real argument but will only return a complex result if called with a complex argument. Try log(Complex(x)).
Stacktrace:
 [1] throw_complex_domainerror(::Symbol, ::Float64) at ./math.jl:31
[...]

julia> log(2, -3)
ERROR: DomainError with -3.0:
log was called with a negative real argument but will only return a complex result if called with a complex argument. Try log(Complex(x)).
Stacktrace:
 [1] throw_complex_domainerror(::Symbol, ::Float64) at ./math.jl:31
[...]
```

!!! note
    If `b` is a power of 2 or 10, [`log2`](@ref) or [`log10`](@ref) should be used, as these will typically be faster and more accurate. For example,

    ```jldoctest
    julia> log(100,1000000)
    2.9999999999999996

    julia> log10(1000000)/2
    3.0
    ```
