```
Base.include([mapexpr::Function,] m::Module, path::AbstractString)
```

Evaluate the contents of the input source file in the global scope of module `m`. Every module (except those defined with [`baremodule`](@ref)) has its own definition of `include` omitting the `m` argument, which evaluates the file in that module. Returns the result of the last evaluated expression of the input file. During including, a task-local include path is set to the directory containing the file. Nested calls to `include` will search relative to that path. This function is typically used to load source interactively, or to combine files in packages that are broken into multiple source files.

The optional first argument `mapexpr` can be used to transform the included code before it is evaluated: for each parsed expression `expr` in `path`, the `include` function actually evaluates `mapexpr(expr)`.  If it is omitted, `mapexpr` defaults to [`identity`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Julia 1.5 is required for passing the `mapexpr` argument.
