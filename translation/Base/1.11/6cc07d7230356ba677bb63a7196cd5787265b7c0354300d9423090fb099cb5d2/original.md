```
unsafe_convert(T, x)
```

Convert `x` to a C argument of type `T` where the input `x` must be the return value of `cconvert(T, ...)`.

In cases where [`convert`](@ref) would need to take a Julia object and turn it into a `Ptr`, this function should be used to define and perform that conversion.

Be careful to ensure that a Julia reference to `x` exists as long as the result of this function will be used. Accordingly, the argument `x` to this function should never be an expression, only a variable name or field reference. For example, `x=a.b.c` is acceptable, but `x=[a,b,c]` is not.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that using the result of this function after the `x` argument to this function is no longer accessible to the program may cause undefined behavior, including program corruption or segfaults, at any later time.
