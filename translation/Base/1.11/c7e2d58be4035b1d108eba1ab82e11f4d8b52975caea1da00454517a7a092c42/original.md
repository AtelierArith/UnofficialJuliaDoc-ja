```
read(s::IOStream, nb::Integer; all=true)
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `s`, returning a `Vector{UInt8}` of the bytes read.

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.
