```
length(s::AbstractString) -> Int
length(s::AbstractString, i::Integer, j::Integer) -> Int
```

Return the number of characters in string `s` from indices `i` through `j`.

This is computed as the number of code unit indices from `i` to `j` which are valid character indices. With only a single string argument, this computes the number of characters in the entire string. With `i` and `j` arguments it computes the number of indices between `i` and `j` inclusive that are valid indices in the string `s`. In addition to in-bounds values, `i` may take the out-of-bounds value `ncodeunits(s) + 1` and `j` may take the out-of-bounds value `0`.

!!! note
    The time complexity of this operation is linear in general. That is, it will take the time proportional to the number of bytes or characters in the string because it counts the value on the fly. This is in contrast to the method for arrays, which is a constant-time operation.
