```
Threads.atomic_cas!(x::Atomic{T}, cmp::T, newval::T) where T
```

Atomically compare-and-set `x`

Atomically compares the value in `x` with `cmp`. If equal, write `newval` to `x`. Otherwise, leaves `x` unmodified. Returns the old value in `x`. By comparing the returned value to `cmp` (via `===`) one knows whether `x` was modified and now holds the new value `newval`.

For further details, see LLVM's `cmpxchg` instruction.

This function can be used to implement transactional semantics. Before the transaction, one records the value in `x`. After the transaction, the new value is stored only if `x` has not been modified in the mean time.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = Threads.Atomic{Int}(3)
Base.Threads.Atomic{Int64}(3)

julia> Threads.atomic_cas!(x, 4, 2);

julia> x
Base.Threads.Atomic{Int64}(3)

julia> Threads.atomic_cas!(x, 3, 2);

julia> x
Base.Threads.Atomic{Int64}(2)
```
