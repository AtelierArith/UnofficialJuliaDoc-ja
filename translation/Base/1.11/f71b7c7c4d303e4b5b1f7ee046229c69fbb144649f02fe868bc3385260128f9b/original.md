```
IOContext(io::IO, KV::Pair...)
```

Create an `IOContext` that wraps a given stream, adding the specified `key=>value` pairs to the properties of that stream (note that `io` can itself be an `IOContext`).

  * use `(key => value) in io` to see if this particular combination is in the properties set
  * use `get(io, key, default)` to retrieve the most recent value for a particular key

The following properties are in common use:

  * `:compact`: Boolean specifying that values should be printed more compactly, e.g. that numbers should be printed with fewer digits. This is set when printing array elements. `:compact` output should not contain line breaks.
  * `:limit`: Boolean specifying that containers should be truncated, e.g. showing `â€¦` in place of most elements.
  * `:displaysize`: A `Tuple{Int,Int}` giving the size in rows and columns to use for text output. This can be used to override the display size for called functions, but to get the size of the screen use the `displaysize` function.
  * `:typeinfo`: a `Type` characterizing the information already printed concerning the type of the object about to be displayed. This is mainly useful when displaying a collection of objects of the same type, so that redundant type information can be avoided (e.g. `[Float16(0)]` can be shown as "Float16[0.0]" instead of "Float16[Float16(0.0)]" : while displaying the elements of the array, the `:typeinfo` property will be set to `Float16`).
  * `:color`: Boolean specifying whether ANSI color/escape codes are supported/expected. By default, this is determined by whether `io` is a compatible terminal and by any `--color` command-line flag when `julia` was launched.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> printstyled(IOContext(io, :color => true), "string", color=:red)

julia> String(take!(io))
"\e[31mstring\e[39m"

julia> printstyled(io, "string", color=:red)

julia> String(take!(io))
"string"
```

```jldoctest
julia> print(IOContext(stdout, :compact => false), 1.12341234)
1.12341234
julia> print(IOContext(stdout, :compact => true), 1.12341234)
1.12341
```

```jldoctest
julia> function f(io::IO)
           if get(io, :short, false)
               print(io, "short")
           else
               print(io, "loooooong")
           end
       end
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(stdout)
loooooong
julia> f(IOContext(stdout, :short => true))
short
```
