```
foreach(f, c...) -> Nothing
```

Call function `f` on each element of iterable `c`. For multiple iterable arguments, `f` is called elementwise, and iteration stops when any iterator is finished.

`foreach` should be used instead of [`map`](@ref) when the results of `f` are not needed, for example in `foreach(println, array)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tri = 1:3:7; res = Int[];

julia> foreach(x -> push!(res, x^2), tri)

julia> res
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
 16
 49

julia> foreach((x, y) -> println(x, " with ", y), tri, 'a':'z')
1 with a
4 with b
7 with c
```
