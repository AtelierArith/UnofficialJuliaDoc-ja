```
in(collection)
âˆˆ(collection)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument is [`in`](@ref) `collection`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y in collection`. See also [`insorted`](@ref) for use with sorted collections.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(in)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
