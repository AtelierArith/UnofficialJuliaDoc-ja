```
@s_str -> SubstitutionString
```

Construct a substitution string, used for regular expression substitutions.  Within the string, sequences of the form `\N` refer to the Nth capture group in the regex, and `\g<groupname>` refers to a named capture group with name `groupname`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> msg = "#Hello# from Julia";

julia> replace(msg, r"#(.+)# from (?<from>\w+)" => s"FROM: \g<from>; MESSAGE: \1")
"FROM: Julia; MESSAGE: Hello"
```
