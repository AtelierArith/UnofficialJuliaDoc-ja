```
nextind(str::AbstractString, i::Integer, n::Integer=1) -> Int
```

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts after index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the next character; if `i` is not the start of a character, move forward until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `0` return `1`. If `i` is in bounds but greater or equal to `lastindex(str)` return `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `nextind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `nextind` would reach `ncodeunits(str)+1` then each remaining iteration increases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `nextind` can return a value greater than `ncodeunits(str)+1`.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `s` or is equal to `0`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

julia> nextind("α", 0, 2)
