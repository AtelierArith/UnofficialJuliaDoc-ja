```
unsafe_wrap(Array, pointer::Ptr{T}, dims; own = false)
```

Wrap a Julia `Array` object around the data at the address given by `pointer`, without making a copy.  The pointer element type `T` determines the array element type. `dims` is either an integer (for a 1d array) or a tuple of the array dimensions. `own` optionally specifies whether Julia should take ownership of the memory, calling `free` on the pointer when the array is no longer referenced.

This function is labeled "unsafe" because it will crash if `pointer` is not a valid memory address to data of the requested length. Unlike [`unsafe_load`](@ref) and [`unsafe_store!`](@ref), the programmer is responsible also for ensuring that the underlying data is not accessed through two arrays of different element type, similar to the strict aliasing rule in C.
