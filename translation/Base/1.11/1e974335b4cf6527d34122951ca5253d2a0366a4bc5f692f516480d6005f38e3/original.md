```
atexit(f)
```

Register a zero- or one-argument function `f()` to be called at process exit. `atexit()` hooks are called in last in first out (LIFO) order and run before object finalizers.

If `f` has a method defined for one integer argument, it will be called as `f(n::Int32)`, where `n` is the current exit code, otherwise it will be called as `f()`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.9"
    The one-argument form requires Julia 1.9


Exit hooks are allowed to call `exit(n)`, in which case Julia will exit with exit code `n` (instead of the original exit code). If more than one exit hook calls `exit(n)`, then Julia will exit with the exit code corresponding to the last called exit hook that calls `exit(n)`. (Because exit hooks are called in LIFO order, "last called" is equivalent to "first registered".)

Note: Once all exit hooks have been called, no more exit hooks can be registered, and any call to `atexit(f)` after all hooks have completed will throw an exception. This situation may occur if you are registering exit hooks from background Tasks that may still be executing concurrently during shutdown.
