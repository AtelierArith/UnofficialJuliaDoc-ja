```
pipeline(from, to, ...)
```

Create a pipeline from a data source to a destination. The source and destination can be commands, I/O streams, strings, or results of other `pipeline` calls. At least one argument must be a command. Strings refer to filenames. When called with more than two arguments, they are chained together from left to right. For example, `pipeline(a,b,c)` is equivalent to `pipeline(pipeline(a,b),c)`. This provides a more concise way to specify multi-stage pipelines.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`ls`, `grep xyz`))
run(pipeline(`ls`, "out.txt"))
run(pipeline("out.txt", `grep xyz`))
```
