Checked
```

The Checked module provides arithmetic functions for the built-in signed and unsigned Integer types which throw an error when an overflow occurs. They are named like `checked_sub`, `checked_div`, etc. In addition, `add_with_overflow`, `sub_with_overflow`, `mul_with_overflow` return both the unchecked results and a boolean value denoting the presence of an overflow.
