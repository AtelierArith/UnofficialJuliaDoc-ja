```
broadcast!(f, dest, As...)
```

Like [`broadcast`](@ref), but store the result of `broadcast(f, As...)` in the `dest` array. Note that `dest` is only used to store the result, and does not supply arguments to `f` unless it is also listed in the `As`, as in `broadcast!(f, A, A, B)` to perform `A[:] = broadcast(f, A, B)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1.0; 0.0]; B = [0.0; 0.0];

julia> broadcast!(+, B, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
 -2.0

julia> A
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0

julia> broadcast!(+, A, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> A
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
 -2.0
```
