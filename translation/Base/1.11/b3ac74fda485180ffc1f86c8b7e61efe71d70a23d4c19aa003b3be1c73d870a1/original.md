```
vec(a::AbstractArray) -> AbstractVector
```

Reshape the array `a` as a one-dimensional column vector. Return `a` if it is already an `AbstractVector`. The resulting array shares the same underlying data as `a`, so it will only be mutable if `a` is mutable, in which case modifying one will also modify the other.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2Ã—3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> vec(a)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 2
 5
 3
 6

julia> vec(1:3)
1:3
```
