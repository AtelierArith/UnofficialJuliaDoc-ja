```
findnext(predicate::Function, A, i)
```

Find the next index after or including `i` of an element of `A` for which `predicate` returns `true`, or `nothing` if not found. This works for Arrays, Strings, and most other collections that support [`getindex`](@ref), [`keys(A)`](@ref), and [`nextind`](@ref).

Indices are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 4, 2, 2];

julia> findnext(isodd, A, 1)
1

julia> findnext(isodd, A, 2) # returns nothing, but not printed in the REPL

julia> A = [1 4; 2 2];

julia> findnext(isodd, A, CartesianIndex(1, 1))
CartesianIndex(1, 1)

julia> findnext(isspace, "a b c", 3)
4
```
