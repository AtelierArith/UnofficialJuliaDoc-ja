```
findprev(predicate::Function, A, i)
```

Find the previous index before or including `i` of an element of `A` for which `predicate` returns `true`, or `nothing` if not found. This works for Arrays, Strings, and most other collections that support [`getindex`](@ref), [`keys(A)`](@ref), and [`nextind`](@ref).

Indices are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [4, 6, 1, 2]
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 6
 1
 2

julia> findprev(isodd, A, 1) # returns nothing, but not printed in the REPL

julia> findprev(isodd, A, 3)
3

julia> A = [4 6; 1 2]
2Ã—2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  6
 1  2

julia> findprev(isodd, A, CartesianIndex(1, 2))
CartesianIndex(2, 1)

julia> findprev(isspace, "a b c", 3)
2
```
