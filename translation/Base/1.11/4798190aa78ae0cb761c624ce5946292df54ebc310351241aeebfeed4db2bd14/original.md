```
ENV
```

Reference to the singleton `EnvDict`, providing a dictionary interface to system environment variables.

(On Windows, system environment variables are case-insensitive, and `ENV` correspondingly converts all keys to uppercase for display, iteration, and copying. Portable code should not rely on the ability to distinguish variables by case, and should beware that setting an ostensibly lowercase variable may result in an uppercase `ENV` key.)

!!! warning
    Mutating the environment is not thread-safe.


# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> ENV
Base.EnvDict with "50" entries:
  "SECURITYSESSIONID"            => "123"
  "USER"                         => "username"
  "MallocNanoZone"               => "0"
  ⋮                              => ⋮

julia> ENV["JULIA_EDITOR"] = "vim"
"vim"

julia> ENV["JULIA_EDITOR"]
"vim"
```
