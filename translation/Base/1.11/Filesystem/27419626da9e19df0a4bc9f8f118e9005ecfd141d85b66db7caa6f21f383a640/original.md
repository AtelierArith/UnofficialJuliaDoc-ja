```
cp(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false, follow_symlinks::Bool=false)
```

Copy the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`.

If `follow_symlinks=false`, and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be created as a symbolic link. If `follow_symlinks=true` and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be a copy of the file or directory `src` refers to. Return `dst`.

!!! note
    The `cp` function is different from the `cp` command. The `cp` function always operates on the assumption that `dst` is a file, while the command does different things depending on whether `dst` is a directory or a file. Using `force=true` when `dst` is a directory will result in loss of all the contents present in the `dst` directory, and `dst` will become a file that has the contents of `src` instead.
