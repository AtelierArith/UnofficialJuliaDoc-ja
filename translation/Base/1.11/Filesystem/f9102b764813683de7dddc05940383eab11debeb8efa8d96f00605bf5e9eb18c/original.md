```
tempdir()
```

Gets the path of the temporary directory. On Windows, `tempdir()` uses the first environment variable found in the ordered list `TMP`, `TEMP`, `USERPROFILE`. On all other operating systems, `tempdir()` uses the first environment variable found in the ordered list `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, `TEMP`, and `TEMPDIR`. If none of these are found, the path `"/tmp"` is used.
