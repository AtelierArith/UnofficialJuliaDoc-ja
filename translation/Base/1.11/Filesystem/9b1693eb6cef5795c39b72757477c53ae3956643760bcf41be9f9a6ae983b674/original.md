```
mktemp(parent=tempdir(); cleanup=true) -> (path, io)
```

Return `(path, io)`, where `path` is the path of a new temporary file in `parent` and `io` is an open file object for this path. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary file is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    The `cleanup` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.3. Relatedly, starting from 1.3, Julia will remove the temporary paths created by `mktemp` when the Julia process exits, unless `cleanup` is explicitly set to `false`.
