```
ifelse(condition::Bool, x, y)
```

Return `x` if `condition` is `true`, otherwise return `y`. This differs from `?` or `if` in that it is an ordinary function, so all the arguments are evaluated first. In some cases, using `ifelse` instead of an `if` statement can eliminate the branch in generated code and provide higher performance in tight loops.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ifelse(1 > 2, 1, 2)
2
```
