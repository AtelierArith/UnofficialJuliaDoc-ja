```
pointer_from_objref(x)
```

Get the memory address of a Julia object as a `Ptr`. The existence of the resulting `Ptr` will not protect the object from garbage collection, so you must ensure that the object remains referenced for the whole time that the `Ptr` will be used.

This function may not be called on immutable objects, since they do not have stable memory addresses.

See also [`unsafe_pointer_to_objref`](@ref).
