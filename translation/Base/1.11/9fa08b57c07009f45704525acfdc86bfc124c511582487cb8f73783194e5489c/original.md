```
findmax!(rval, rind, A) -> (maxval, index)
```

Find the maximum of `A` and the corresponding linear index along singleton dimensions of `rval` and `rind`, and store the results in `rval` and `rind`. `NaN` is treated as greater than all other values except `missing`.

!!! warning
    Behavior can be unexpected when any mutated argument shares memory with any other argument.
