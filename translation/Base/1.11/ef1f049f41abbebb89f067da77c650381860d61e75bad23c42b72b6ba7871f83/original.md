```
@raw_str -> String
```

Create a raw string without interpolation and unescaping. The exception is that quotation marks still must be escaped. Backslashes escape both quotation marks and other backslashes, but only when a sequence of backslashes precedes a quote character. Thus, 2n backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes and the end of the literal while 2n+1 backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes followed by a quote character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> println(raw"\ $x")
\ $x

julia> println(raw"\"")
"

julia> println(raw"\\\"")
\"

julia> println(raw"\\x \\\"")
\\x \"
```
