```
code_lowered(f, types; generated=true, debuginfo=:default)
```

Return an array of the lowered forms (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

If `generated` is `false`, the returned `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to fallback implementations. An error is thrown if no fallback implementation exists. If `generated` is `true`, these `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to the method bodies yielded by expanding the generators.

The keyword `debuginfo` controls the amount of code metadata present in the output.

Note that an error will be thrown if `types` are not leaf types when `generated` is `true` and any of the corresponding methods are an `@generated` method.
