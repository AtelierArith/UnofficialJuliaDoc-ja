```
to_indices(A, I::Tuple)
```

Convert the tuple `I` to a tuple of indices for use in indexing into array `A`.

The returned tuple must only contain either `Int`s or `AbstractArray`s of scalar indices that are supported by array `A`. It will error upon encountering a novel index type that it does not know how to process.

For simple index types, it defers to the unexported `Base.to_index(A, i)` to process each index `i`. While this internal function is not intended to be called directly, `Base.to_index` may be extended by custom array or index types to provide custom indexing behaviors.

More complicated index types may require more context about the dimension into which they index. To support those cases, `to_indices(A, I)` calls `to_indices(A, axes(A), I)`, which then recursively walks through both the given tuple of indices and the dimensional indices of `A` in tandem. As such, not all index types are guaranteed to propagate to `Base.to_index`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(1,2,3,4);

julia> to_indices(A, (1,1,2,2))
(1, 1, 2, 2)

julia> to_indices(A, (1,1,2,20)) # no bounds checking
(1, 1, 2, 20)

julia> to_indices(A, (CartesianIndex((1,)), 2, CartesianIndex((3,4)))) # exotic index
(1, 2, 3, 4)

julia> to_indices(A, ([1,1], 1:2, 3, 4))
([1, 1], 1:2, 3, 4)

julia> to_indices(A, (1,2)) # no shape checking
(1, 2)
```
