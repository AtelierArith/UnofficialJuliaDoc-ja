```
finalizer(f, x)
```

Register a function `f(x)` to be called when there are no program-accessible references to `x`, and return `x`. The type of `x` must be a `mutable struct`, otherwise the function will throw.

`f` must not cause a task switch, which excludes most I/O operations such as `println`. Using the `@async` macro (to defer context switching to outside of the finalizer) or `ccall` to directly invoke IO functions in C may be helpful for debugging purposes.

Note that there is no guaranteed world age for the execution of `f`. It may be called in the world age in which the finalizer was registered or any later world age.

# Examples

```julia
finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    @async println("Finalizing $x.")
end

finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    ccall(:jl_safe_printf, Cvoid, (Cstring, Cstring), "Finalizing %s.", repr(x))
end
```

A finalizer may be registered at object construction. In the following example note that we implicitly rely on the finalizer returning the newly created mutable struct `x`.

```julia
mutable struct MyMutableStruct
    bar
    function MyMutableStruct(bar)
        x = new(bar)
        f(t) = @async println("Finalizing $t.")
        finalizer(f, x)
    end
end
```
