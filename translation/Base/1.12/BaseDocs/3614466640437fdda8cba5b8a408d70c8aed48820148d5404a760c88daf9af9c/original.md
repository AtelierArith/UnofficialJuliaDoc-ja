```julia
nothing
```

The singleton instance of type [`Nothing`](@ref), used by convention when there is no value to return (as in a C `void` function) or when a variable or field holds no value.

A return value of `nothing` is not displayed by the REPL and similar interactive environments.

See also: [`isnothing`](@ref), [`something`](@ref), [`missing`](@ref).
