```julia
Threads.atomic_nand!(x::Atomic{T}, val::T) where T
```

Atomically bitwise-nand (not-and) `x` with `val`

Performs `x[] = ~(x[] & val)` atomically. Returns the **old** value.

For further details, see LLVM's `atomicrmw nand` instruction.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = Threads.Atomic{Int}(3)
Base.Threads.Atomic{Int64}(3)

julia> Threads.atomic_nand!(x, 2)
3

julia> x[]
-3
```
