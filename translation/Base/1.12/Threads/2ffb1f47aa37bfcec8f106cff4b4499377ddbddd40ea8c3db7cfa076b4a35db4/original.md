```julia
Threads.atomic_or!(x::Atomic{T}, val::T) where T
```

Atomically bitwise-or `x` with `val`

Performs `x[] |= val` atomically. Returns the **old** value.

For further details, see LLVM's `atomicrmw or` instruction.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = Threads.Atomic{Int}(5)
Base.Threads.Atomic{Int64}(5)

julia> Threads.atomic_or!(x, 7)
5

julia> x[]
7
```
