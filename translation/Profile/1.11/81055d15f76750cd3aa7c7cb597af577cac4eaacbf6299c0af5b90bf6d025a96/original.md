```
init(; n::Integer, delay::Real)
```

Configure the `delay` between backtraces (measured in seconds), and the number `n` of instruction pointers that may be stored per thread. Each instruction pointer corresponds to a single line of code; backtraces generally consist of a long list of instruction pointers. Note that 6 spaces for instruction pointers per backtrace are used to store metadata and two NULL end markers. Current settings can be obtained by calling this function with no arguments, and each can be set independently using keywords or in the order `(n, delay)`.
