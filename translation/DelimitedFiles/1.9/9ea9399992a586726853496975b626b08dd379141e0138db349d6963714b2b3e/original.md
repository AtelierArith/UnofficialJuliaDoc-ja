```
writedlm(f, A, delim='\t'; opts)
```

Write `A` (a vector, matrix, or an iterable collection of iterable rows) as text to `f` (either a filename string or an `IO` stream) using the given delimiter `delim` (which defaults to tab, but can be any printable Julia object, typically a `Char` or `AbstractString`).

For example, two vectors `x` and `y` of the same length can be written as two columns of tab-delimited text to `f` by either `writedlm(f, [x y])` or by `writedlm(f, zip(x, y))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> using DelimitedFiles

julia> x = [1; 2; 3; 4];

julia> y = [5; 6; 7; 8];

julia> open("delim_file.txt", "w") do io
           writedlm(io, [x y])
       end

julia> readdlm("delim_file.txt", '\t', Int, '\n')
4Ã—2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  5
 2  6
 3  7
 4  8

julia> rm("delim_file.txt")
```
