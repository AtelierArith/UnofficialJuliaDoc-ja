```
merge!(repo::GitRepo; kwargs...) -> Bool
```

Perform a git merge on the repository `repo`, merging commits with diverging history into the current branch. Return `true` if the merge succeeded, `false` if not.

The keyword arguments are:

  * `committish::AbstractString=""`: Merge the named commit(s) in `committish`.
  * `branch::AbstractString=""`: Merge the branch `branch` and all its commits since it diverged from the current branch.
  * `fastforward::Bool=false`: If `fastforward` is `true`, only merge if the merge is a fast-forward (the current branch head is an ancestor of the commits to be merged), otherwise refuse to merge and return `false`. This is equivalent to the git CLI option `--ff-only`.
  * `merge_opts::MergeOptions=MergeOptions()`: `merge_opts` specifies options for the merge, such as merge strategy in case of conflicts.
  * `checkout_opts::CheckoutOptions=CheckoutOptions()`: `checkout_opts` specifies options for the checkout step.

Equivalent to `git merge [--ff-only] [<committish> | <branch>]`.

!!! note
    If you specify a `branch`, this must be done in reference format, since the string will be turned into a `GitReference`. For example, if you wanted to merge branch `branch_a`, you would call `merge!(repo, branch="refs/heads/branch_a")`.
