```
branch!(repo::GitRepo, branch_name::AbstractString, commit::AbstractString=""; kwargs...)
```

Checkout a new git branch in the `repo` repository. `commit` is the [`GitHash`](@ref), in string form, which will be the start of the new branch. If `commit` is an empty string, the current HEAD will be used.

The keyword arguments are:

  * `track::AbstractString=""`: the name of the remote branch this new branch should track, if any. If empty (the default), no remote branch will be tracked.
  * `force::Bool=false`: if `true`, branch creation will be forced.
  * `set_head::Bool=true`: if `true`, after the branch creation finishes the branch head will be set as the HEAD of `repo`.

Equivalent to `git checkout [-b|-B] <branch_name> [<commit>] [--track <track>]`.

# Examples

```julia
repo = LibGit2.GitRepo(repo_path)
LibGit2.branch!(repo, "new_branch", set_head=false)
```
