```
approve(payload::CredentialPayload; shred::Bool=true) -> Nothing
```

Store the `payload` credential for re-use in a future authentication. Should only be called when authentication was successful.

The `shred` keyword controls whether sensitive information in the payload credential field should be destroyed. Should only be set to `false` during testing.
