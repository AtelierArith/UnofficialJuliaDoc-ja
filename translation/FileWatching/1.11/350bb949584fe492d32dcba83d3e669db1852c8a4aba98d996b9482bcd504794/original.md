```
watch_folder(path::AbstractString, timeout_s::Real=-1)
```

Watches a file or directory `path` for changes until a change has occurred or `timeout_s` seconds have elapsed. This function does not poll the file system and instead uses platform-specific functionality to receive notifications from the operating system (e.g. via inotify on Linux). See the NodeJS documentation linked below for details.

This will continuing tracking changes for `path` in the background until `unwatch_folder` is called on the same `path`.

The returned value is an pair where the first field is the name of the changed file (if available) and the second field is an object with boolean fields `renamed`, `changed`, and `timedout`, giving the event.

This behavior of this function varies slightly across platforms. See [https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_caveats](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_caveats) for more detailed information.
