```
round(dt::TimeType, p::Period, [r::RoundingMode]) -> TimeType
```

Return the `Date` or `DateTime` nearest to `dt` at resolution `p`. By default (`RoundNearestTiesUp`), ties (e.g., rounding 9:30 to the nearest hour) will be rounded up.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `round(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `round(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> round(Date(1985, 8, 16), Month)
1985-08-01

julia> round(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:30:00

julia> round(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Day)
2016-08-07T00:00:00
```

Valid rounding modes for `round(::TimeType, ::Period, ::RoundingMode)` are `RoundNearestTiesUp` (default), `RoundDown` (`floor`), and `RoundUp` (`ceil`).
