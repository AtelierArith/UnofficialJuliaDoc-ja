```julia
CompoundPeriod
```

A `CompoundPeriod` is useful for expressing time periods that are not a fixed multiple of smaller periods. For example, "a year and a  day" is not a fixed number of days, but can be expressed using a `CompoundPeriod`. In fact, a `CompoundPeriod` is automatically generated by addition of different period types, e.g. `Year(1) + Day(1)` produces a `CompoundPeriod` result.
