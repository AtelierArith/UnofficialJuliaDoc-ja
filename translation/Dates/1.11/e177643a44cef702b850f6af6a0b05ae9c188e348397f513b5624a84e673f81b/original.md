```
ceil(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` up to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Day(16), Week)
3 weeks

julia> ceil(Minute(44), Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> ceil(Hour(36), Day)
2 days
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
