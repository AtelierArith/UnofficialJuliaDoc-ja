```
record(ts::AbstractTestSet, res::Result)
```

Record a result to a testset. This function is called by the `@testset` infrastructure each time a contained `@test` macro completes, and is given the test result (which could be an `Error`). This will also be called with an `Error` if an exception is thrown inside the test block but outside of a `@test` context.
