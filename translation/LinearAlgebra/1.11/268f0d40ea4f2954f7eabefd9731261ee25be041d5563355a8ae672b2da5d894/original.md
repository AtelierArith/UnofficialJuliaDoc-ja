```
Transpose
```

Lazy wrapper type for a transpose view of the underlying linear algebra object, usually an `AbstractVector`/`AbstractMatrix`. Usually, the `Transpose` constructor should not be called directly, use [`transpose`](@ref) instead. To materialize the view use [`copy`](@ref).

This type is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [2 3; 0 0]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  3
 0  0

julia> Transpose(A)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 2  0
 3  0
```
