SymTridiagonal(dv::V, ev::V) where V <: AbstractVector
```

Construct a symmetric tridiagonal matrix from the diagonal (`dv`) and first sub/super-diagonal (`ev`), respectively. The result is of type `SymTridiagonal` and provides efficient specialized eigensolvers, but may be converted into a regular matrix with [`convert(Array, _)`](@ref) (or `Array(_)` for short).

For `SymTridiagonal` block matrices, the elements of `dv` are symmetrized. The argument `ev` is interpreted as the superdiagonal. Blocks from the subdiagonal are (materialized) transpose of the corresponding superdiagonal blocks.
