```
stebz!(range, order, vl, vu, il, iu, abstol, dv, ev) -> (dv, iblock, isplit)
```

Computes the eigenvalues for a symmetric tridiagonal matrix with `dv` as diagonal and `ev` as off-diagonal. If `range = A`, all the eigenvalues are found. If `range = V`, the eigenvalues in the half-open interval `(vl, vu]` are found. If `range = I`, the eigenvalues with indices between `il` and `iu` are found. If `order = B`, eigvalues are ordered within a block. If `order = E`, they are ordered across all the blocks. `abstol` can be set as a tolerance for convergence.
