stein!(dv, ev_in, w_in, iblock_in, isplit_in)
```

Computes the eigenvectors for a symmetric tridiagonal matrix with `dv` as diagonal and `ev_in` as off-diagonal. `w_in` specifies the input eigenvalues for which to find corresponding eigenvectors. `iblock_in` specifies the submatrices corresponding to the eigenvalues in `w_in`. `isplit_in` specifies the splitting points between the submatrix blocks.
