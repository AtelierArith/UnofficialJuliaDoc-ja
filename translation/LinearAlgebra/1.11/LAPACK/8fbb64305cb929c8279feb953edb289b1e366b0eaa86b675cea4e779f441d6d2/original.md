```
getrf!(A) -> (A, ipiv, info)
```

Compute the pivoted `LU` factorization of `A`, `A = LU`.

Returns `A`, modified in-place, `ipiv`, the pivoting information, and an `info` code which indicates success (`info = 0`), a singular value in `U` (`info = i`, in which case `U[i,i]` is singular), or an error code (`info < 0`).
