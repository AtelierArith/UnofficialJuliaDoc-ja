```
stegr!(jobz, range, dv, ev, vl, vu, il, iu) -> (w, Z)
```

Computes the eigenvalues (`jobz = N`) or eigenvalues and eigenvectors (`jobz = V`) for a symmetric tridiagonal matrix with `dv` as diagonal and `ev` as off-diagonal. If `range = A`, all the eigenvalues are found. If `range = V`, the eigenvalues in the half-open interval `(vl, vu]` are found. If `range = I`, the eigenvalues with indices between `il` and `iu` are found. The eigenvalues are returned in `w` and the eigenvectors in `Z`.
