gesvx!(fact, trans, A, AF, ipiv, equed, R, C, B) -> (X, equed, R, C, B, rcond, ferr, berr, work)
```

Solves the linear equation `A * X = B` (`trans = N`), `transpose(A) * X = B` (`trans = T`), or `adjoint(A) * X = B` (`trans = C`) using the `LU` factorization of `A`. `fact` may be `E`, in which case `A` will be equilibrated and copied to `AF`; `F`, in which case `AF` and `ipiv` from a previous `LU` factorization are inputs; or `N`, in which case `A` will be copied to `AF` and then factored. If `fact = F`, `equed` may be `N`, meaning `A` has not been equilibrated; `R`, meaning `A` was multiplied by `Diagonal(R)` from the left; `C`, meaning `A` was multiplied by `Diagonal(C)` from the right; or `B`, meaning `A` was multiplied by `Diagonal(R)` from the left and `Diagonal(C)` from the right. If `fact = F` and `equed = R` or `B` the elements of `R` must all be positive. If `fact = F` and `equed = C` or `B` the elements of `C` must all be positive.

Returns the solution `X`; `equed`, which is an output if `fact` is not `N`, and describes the equilibration that was performed; `R`, the row equilibration diagonal; `C`, the column equilibration diagonal; `B`, which may be overwritten with its equilibrated form `Diagonal(R)*B` (if `trans = N` and `equed = R,B`) or `Diagonal(C)*B` (if `trans = T,C` and `equed = C,B`); `rcond`, the reciprocal condition number of `A` after equilbrating; `ferr`, the forward error bound for each solution vector in `X`; `berr`, the forward error bound for each solution vector in `X`; and `work`, the reciprocal pivot growth factor.
