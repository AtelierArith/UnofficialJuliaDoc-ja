```
sysv!(uplo, A, B) -> (B, A, ipiv)
```

Finds the solution to `A * X = B` for symmetric matrix `A`. If `uplo = U`, the upper half of `A` is stored. If `uplo = L`, the lower half is stored. `B` is overwritten by the solution `X`. `A` is overwritten by its Bunch-Kaufman factorization. `ipiv` contains pivoting information about the factorization.
