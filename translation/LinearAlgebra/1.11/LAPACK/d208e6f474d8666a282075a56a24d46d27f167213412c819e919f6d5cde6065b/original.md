```
trsyl!(transa, transb, A, B, C, isgn=1) -> (C, scale)
```

Solves the Sylvester matrix equation `A * X +/- X * B = scale*C` where `A` and `B` are both quasi-upper triangular. If `transa = N`, `A` is not modified. If `transa = T`, `A` is transposed. If `transa = C`, `A` is conjugate transposed. Similarly for `transb` and `B`. If `isgn = 1`, the equation `A * X + X * B = scale * C` is solved. If `isgn = -1`, the equation `A * X - X * B = scale * C` is solved.

Returns `X` (overwriting `C`) and `scale`.
