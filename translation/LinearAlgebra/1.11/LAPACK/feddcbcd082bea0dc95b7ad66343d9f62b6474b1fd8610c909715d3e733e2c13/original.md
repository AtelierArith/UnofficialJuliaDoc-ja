```
syconv!(uplo, A, ipiv) -> (A, work)
```

Converts a symmetric matrix `A` (which has been factorized into a triangular matrix) into two matrices `L` and `D`. If `uplo = U`, `A` is upper triangular. If `uplo = L`, it is lower triangular. `ipiv` is the pivot vector from the triangular factorization. `A` is overwritten by `L` and `D`.
