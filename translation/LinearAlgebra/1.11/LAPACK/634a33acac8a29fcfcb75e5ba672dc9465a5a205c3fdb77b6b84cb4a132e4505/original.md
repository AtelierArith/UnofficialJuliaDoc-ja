```
sygvd!(itype, jobz, uplo, A, B) -> (w, A, B)
```

Finds the generalized eigenvalues (`jobz = N`) or eigenvalues and eigenvectors (`jobz = V`) of a symmetric matrix `A` and symmetric positive-definite matrix `B`. If `uplo = U`, the upper triangles of `A` and `B` are used. If `uplo = L`, the lower triangles of `A` and `B` are used. If `itype = 1`, the problem to solve is `A * x = lambda * B * x`. If `itype = 2`, the problem to solve is `A * B * x = lambda * x`. If `itype = 3`, the problem to solve is `B * A * x = lambda * x`.
