geevx!(balanc, jobvl, jobvr, sense, A) -> (A, w, VL, VR, ilo, ihi, scale, abnrm, rconde, rcondv)
```

Finds the eigensystem of `A` with matrix balancing. If `jobvl = N`, the left eigenvectors of `A` aren't computed. If `jobvr = N`, the right eigenvectors of `A` aren't computed. If `jobvl = V` or `jobvr = V`, the corresponding eigenvectors are computed. If `balanc = N`, no balancing is performed. If `balanc = P`, `A` is permuted but not scaled. If `balanc = S`, `A` is scaled but not permuted. If `balanc = B`, `A` is permuted and scaled. If `sense = N`, no reciprocal condition numbers are computed. If `sense = E`, reciprocal condition numbers are computed for the eigenvalues only. If `sense = V`, reciprocal condition numbers are computed for the right eigenvectors only. If `sense = B`, reciprocal condition numbers are computed for the right eigenvectors and the eigenvectors. If `sense = E,B`, the right and left eigenvectors must be computed.
