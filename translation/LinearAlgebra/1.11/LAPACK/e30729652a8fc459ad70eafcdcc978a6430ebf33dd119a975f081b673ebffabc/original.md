```
gbtrs!(trans, kl, ku, m, AB, ipiv, B)
```

Solve the equation `AB * X = B`. `trans` determines the orientation of `AB`. It may be `N` (no transpose), `T` (transpose), or `C` (conjugate transpose). `kl` is the first subdiagonal containing a nonzero band, `ku` is the last superdiagonal containing one, and `m` is the first dimension of the matrix `AB`. `ipiv` is the vector of pivots returned from `gbtrf!`. Returns the vector or matrix `X`, overwriting `B` in-place.
