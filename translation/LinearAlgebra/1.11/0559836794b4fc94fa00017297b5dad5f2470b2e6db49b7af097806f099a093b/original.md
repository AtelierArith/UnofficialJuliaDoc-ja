```
Bidiagonal(dv::V, ev::V, uplo::Symbol) where V <: AbstractVector
```

Constructs an upper (`uplo=:U`) or lower (`uplo=:L`) bidiagonal matrix using the given diagonal (`dv`) and off-diagonal (`ev`) vectors. The result is of type `Bidiagonal` and provides efficient specialized linear solvers, but may be converted into a regular matrix with [`convert(Array, _)`](@ref) (or `Array(_)` for short). The length of `ev` must be one less than the length of `dv`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> dv = [1, 2, 3, 4]
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4

julia> ev = [7, 8, 9]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 7
 8
 9

julia> Bu = Bidiagonal(dv, ev, :U) # ev is on the first superdiagonal
4×4 Bidiagonal{Int64, Vector{Int64}}:
 1  7  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  2  8  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  3  9
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  4

julia> Bl = Bidiagonal(dv, ev, :L) # ev is on the first subdiagonal
4×4 Bidiagonal{Int64, Vector{Int64}}:
 1  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 7  2  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  8  3  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  9  4
