Symmetric(A::AbstractMatrix, uplo::Symbol=:U)
```

Construct a `Symmetric` view of the upper (if `uplo = :U`) or lower (if `uplo = :L`) triangle of the matrix `A`.

`Symmetric` views are mainly useful for real-symmetric matrices, for which specialized algorithms (e.g. for eigenproblems) are enabled for `Symmetric` types. More generally, see also [`Hermitian(A)`](@ref) for Hermitian matrices `A == A'`, which is effectively equivalent to `Symmetric` for real matrices but is also useful for complex matrices.  (Whereas complex `Symmetric` matrices are supported but have few if any specialized algorithms.)

To compute the symmetric part of a real matrix, or more generally the Hermitian part `(A + A') / 2` of a real or complex matrix `A`, use [`hermitianpart`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6
 7  8  9

julia> Supper = Symmetric(A)
3×3 Symmetric{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 1  2  3
 2  5  6
 3  6  9

julia> Slower = Symmetric(A, :L)
3×3 Symmetric{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 1  4  7
 4  5  8
 7  8  9

julia> hermitianpart(A)
3×3 Hermitian{Float64, Matrix{Float64}}:
 1.0  3.0  5.0
 3.0  5.0  7.0
 5.0  7.0  9.0
```

Note that `Supper` will not be equal to `Slower` unless `A` is itself symmetric (e.g. if `A == transpose(A)`).
