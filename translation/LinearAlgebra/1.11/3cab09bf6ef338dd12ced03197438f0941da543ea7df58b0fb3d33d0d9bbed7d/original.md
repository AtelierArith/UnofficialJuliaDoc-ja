```
rank(A::AbstractMatrix; atol::Real=0, rtol::Real=atol>0 ? 0 : n*ϵ)
rank(A::AbstractMatrix, rtol::Real)
```

Compute the numerical rank of a matrix by counting how many outputs of `svdvals(A)` are greater than `max(atol, rtol*σ₁)` where `σ₁` is `A`'s largest calculated singular value. `atol` and `rtol` are the absolute and relative tolerances, respectively. The default relative tolerance is `n*ϵ`, where `n` is the size of the smallest dimension of `A`, and `ϵ` is the [`eps`](@ref) of the element type of `A`.

!!! note
    Numerical rank can be a sensitive and imprecise characterization of ill-conditioned matrices with singular values that are close to the threshold tolerance `max(atol, rtol*σ₁)`. In such cases, slight perturbations to the singular-value computation or to the matrix can change the result of `rank` by pushing one or more singular values across the threshold. These variations can even occur due to changes in floating-point errors between different Julia versions, architectures, compilers, or operating systems.


!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    The `atol` and `rtol` keyword arguments requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 `rtol` is available as a positional argument, but this will be deprecated in Julia 2.0.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rank(Matrix(I, 3, 3))
3

julia> rank(diagm(0 => [1, 0, 2]))
2

julia> rank(diagm(0 => [1, 0.001, 2]), rtol=0.1)
2

julia> rank(diagm(0 => [1, 0.001, 2]), rtol=0.00001)
3

julia> rank(diagm(0 => [1, 0.001, 2]), atol=1.5)
1
