If `A` has no negative real eigenvalue, compute the principal matrix logarithm of `A`, i.e. the unique matrix $X$ such that $e^X = A$ and $-\pi < Im(\lambda) < \pi$ for all the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $X$. If `A` has nonpositive eigenvalues, a nonprincipal matrix function is returned whenever possible.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, if `A` is triangular an improved version of the inverse scaling and squaring method is employed (see [^AH12] and [^AHR13]). If `A` is real with no negative eigenvalues, then the real Schur form is computed. Otherwise, the complex Schur form is computed. Then the upper (quasi-)triangular algorithm in [^AHR13] is used on the upper (quasi-)triangular factor.
