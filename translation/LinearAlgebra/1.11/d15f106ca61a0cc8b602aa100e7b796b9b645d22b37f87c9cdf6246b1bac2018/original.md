```
dot(x, A, y)
```

Compute the generalized dot product `dot(x, A*y)` between two vectors `x` and `y`, without storing the intermediate result of `A*y`. As for the two-argument [`dot(_,_)`](@ref), this acts recursively. Moreover, for complex vectors, the first vector is conjugated.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Three-argument `dot` requires at least Julia 1.4.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> dot([1; 1], [1 2; 3 4], [2; 3])
26

julia> dot(1:5, reshape(1:25, 5, 5), 2:6)
4850

julia> â‹…(1:5, reshape(1:25, 5, 5), 2:6) == dot(1:5, reshape(1:25, 5, 5), 2:6)
true
```
