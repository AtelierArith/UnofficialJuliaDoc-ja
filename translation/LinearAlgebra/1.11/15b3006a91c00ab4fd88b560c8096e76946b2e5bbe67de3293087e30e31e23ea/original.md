```
eigen(A::Union{SymTridiagonal, Hermitian, Symmetric}, vl::Real, vu::Real) -> Eigen
```

Compute the eigenvalue decomposition of `A`, returning an [`Eigen`](@ref) factorization object `F` which contains the eigenvalues in `F.values` and the eigenvectors in the columns of the matrix `F.vectors`. (The `k`th eigenvector can be obtained from the slice `F.vectors[:, k]`.)

Iterating the decomposition produces the components `F.values` and `F.vectors`.

The following functions are available for `Eigen` objects: [`inv`](@ref), [`det`](@ref), and [`isposdef`](@ref).

`vl` is the lower bound of the window of eigenvalues to search for, and `vu` is the upper bound.

!!! note
    If [`vl`, `vu`] does not contain all eigenvalues of `A`, then the returned factorization will be a *truncated* factorization.
