```
graphemes(s::AbstractString) -> GraphemeIterator
```

Return an iterator over substrings of `s` that correspond to the extended graphemes in the string, as defined by Unicode UAX #29. (Roughly, these are what users would perceive as single characters, even though they may contain more than one codepoint; for example a letter combined with an accent mark is a single grapheme.)
