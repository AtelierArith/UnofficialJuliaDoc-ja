The Libdl module in Julia provides specialized and lower-level facilities for dynamic linking with shared libraries. While Julia inherently supports linking to runtime shared libraries through the `ccall` intrinsic, `Libdl` extends this capability by offering additional, more granular control. It enables users to search for shared libraries both in memory and the filesystem, manually load them with specific runtime linker options, and look up library symbols as low-level pointers.
