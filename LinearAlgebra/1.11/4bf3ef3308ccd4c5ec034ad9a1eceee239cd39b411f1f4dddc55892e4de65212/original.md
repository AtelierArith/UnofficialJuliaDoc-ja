```
UniformScaling{T<:Number}
```

Generically sized uniform scaling operator defined as a scalar times the identity operator, `λ*I`. Although without an explicit `size`, it acts similarly to a matrix in many cases and includes support for some indexing. See also [`I`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Indexing using ranges is available as of Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> J = UniformScaling(2.)
UniformScaling{Float64}
2.0*I

julia> A = [1. 2.; 3. 4.]
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  2.0
 3.0  4.0

julia> J*A
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.0  4.0
 6.0  8.0

julia> J[1:2, 1:2]
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.0  0.0
 0.0  2.0
```
