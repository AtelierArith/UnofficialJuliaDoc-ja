```
cholesky(A, NoPivot(); check = true) -> Cholesky
```

Compute the Cholesky factorization of a dense symmetric positive definite matrix `A` and return a [`Cholesky`](@ref) factorization. The matrix `A` can either be a [`Symmetric`](@ref) or [`Hermitian`](@ref) [`AbstractMatrix`](@ref) or a *perfectly* symmetric or Hermitian `AbstractMatrix`.

The triangular Cholesky factor can be obtained from the factorization `F` via `F.L` and `F.U`, where `A ≈ F.U' * F.U ≈ F.L * F.L'`.

The following functions are available for `Cholesky` objects: [`size`](@ref), [`\`](@ref), [`inv`](@ref), [`det`](@ref), [`logdet`](@ref) and [`isposdef`](@ref).

If you have a matrix `A` that is slightly non-Hermitian due to roundoff errors in its construction, wrap it in `Hermitian(A)` before passing it to `cholesky` in order to treat it as perfectly Hermitian.

When `check = true`, an error is thrown if the decomposition fails. When `check = false`, responsibility for checking the decomposition's validity (via [`issuccess`](@ref)) lies with the user.
