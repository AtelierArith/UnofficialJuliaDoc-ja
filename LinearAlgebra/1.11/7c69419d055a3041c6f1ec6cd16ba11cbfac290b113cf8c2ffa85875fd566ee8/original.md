```
isposdef!(A) -> Bool
```

Test whether a matrix is positive definite (and Hermitian) by trying to perform a Cholesky factorization of `A`, overwriting `A` in the process. See also [`isposdef`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1. 2.; 2. 50.];

julia> isposdef!(A)
true

julia> A
2Ã—2 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  2.0
 2.0  6.78233
```
