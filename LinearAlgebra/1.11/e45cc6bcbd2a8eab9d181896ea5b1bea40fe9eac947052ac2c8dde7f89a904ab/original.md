```
opnorm(A::Adjoint{<:Any,<:AbstractVector}, q::Real=2)
opnorm(A::Transpose{<:Any,<:AbstractVector}, q::Real=2)
```

For Adjoint/Transpose-wrapped vectors, return the operator $q$-norm of `A`, which is equivalent to the `p`-norm with value `p = q/(q-1)`. They coincide at `p = q = 2`. Use [`norm`](@ref) to compute the `p` norm of `A` as a vector.

The difference in norm between a vector space and its dual arises to preserve the relationship between duality and the dot product, and the result is consistent with the operator `p`-norm of a `1 Ã— n` matrix.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [1; im];

julia> vc = v';

julia> opnorm(vc, 1)
1.0

julia> norm(vc, 1)
2.0

julia> norm(v, 1)
2.0

julia> opnorm(vc, 2)
1.4142135623730951

julia> norm(vc, 2)
1.4142135623730951

julia> norm(v, 2)
1.4142135623730951

julia> opnorm(vc, Inf)
2.0

julia> norm(vc, Inf)
1.0

julia> norm(v, Inf)
1.0
```
