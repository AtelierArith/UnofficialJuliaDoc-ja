schur(A, B) -> F::GeneralizedSchur
```

Computes the Generalized Schur (or QZ) factorization of the matrices `A` and `B`. The (quasi) triangular Schur factors can be obtained from the `Schur` object `F` with `F.S` and `F.T`, the left unitary/orthogonal Schur vectors can be obtained with `F.left` or `F.Q` and the right unitary/orthogonal Schur vectors can be obtained with `F.right` or `F.Z` such that `A=F.left*F.S*F.right'` and `B=F.left*F.T*F.right'`. The generalized eigenvalues of `A` and `B` can be obtained with `F.α./F.β`.

Iterating the decomposition produces the components `F.S`, `F.T`, `F.Q`, `F.Z`, `F.α`, and `F.β`.
