\(A, B)
```

Matrix division using a polyalgorithm. For input matrices `A` and `B`, the result `X` is such that `A*X == B` when `A` is square. The solver that is used depends upon the structure of `A`.  If `A` is upper or lower triangular (or diagonal), no factorization of `A` is required and the system is solved with either forward or backward substitution. For non-triangular square matrices, an LU factorization is used.

For rectangular `A` the result is the minimum-norm least squares solution computed by a pivoted QR factorization of `A` and a rank estimate of `A` based on the R factor.

When `A` is sparse, a similar polyalgorithm is used. For indefinite matrices, the `LDLt` factorization does not use pivoting during the numerical factorization and therefore the procedure can fail even for invertible matrices.

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 0; 1 -2]; B = [32; -4];

julia> X = A \ B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 32.0
 18.0

julia> A * X == B
true
