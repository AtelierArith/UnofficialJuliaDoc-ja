```
ordschur(F::GeneralizedSchur, select::Union{Vector{Bool},BitVector}) -> F::GeneralizedSchur
```

Reorders the Generalized Schur factorization `F` of a matrix pair `(A, B) = (Q*S*Z', Q*T*Z')` according to the logical array `select` and returns a GeneralizedSchur object `F`. The selected eigenvalues appear in the leading diagonal of both `F.S` and `F.T`, and the left and right orthogonal/unitary Schur vectors are also reordered such that `(A, B) = F.Q*(F.S, F.T)*F.Z'` still holds and the generalized eigenvalues of `A` and `B` can still be obtained with `F.α./F.β`.
