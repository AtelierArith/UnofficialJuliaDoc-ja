```
Diagonal(V::AbstractVector)
```

Construct a lazy matrix with `V` as its diagonal.

See also [`UniformScaling`](@ref) for the lazy identity matrix `I`, [`diagm`](@ref) to make a dense matrix, and [`diag`](@ref) to extract diagonal elements.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Diagonal([1, 10, 100])
3×3 Diagonal{Int64, Vector{Int64}}:
 1   ⋅    ⋅
 ⋅  10    ⋅
 ⋅   ⋅  100

julia> diagm([7, 13])
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 7   0
 0  13

julia> ans + I
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 8   0
 0  14

julia> I(2)
2×2 Diagonal{Bool, Vector{Bool}}:
 1  ⋅
 ⋅  1
```

!!! note
    A one-column matrix is not treated like a vector, but instead calls the method `Diagonal(A::AbstractMatrix)` which extracts 1-element `diag(A)`:


```jldoctest
julia> A = transpose([7.0 13.0])
2×1 transpose(::Matrix{Float64}) with eltype Float64:
  7.0
 13.0

julia> Diagonal(A)
1×1 Diagonal{Float64, Vector{Float64}}:
 7.0
```
