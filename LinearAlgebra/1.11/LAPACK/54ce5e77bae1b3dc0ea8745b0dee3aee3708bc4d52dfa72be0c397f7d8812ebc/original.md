```
trevc!(side, howmny, select, T, VL = similar(T), VR = similar(T))
```

Finds the eigensystem of an upper triangular matrix `T`. If `side = R`, the right eigenvectors are computed. If `side = L`, the left eigenvectors are computed. If `side = B`, both sets are computed. If `howmny = A`, all eigenvectors are found. If `howmny = B`, all eigenvectors are found and backtransformed using `VL` and `VR`. If `howmny = S`, only the eigenvectors corresponding to the values in `select` are computed.
