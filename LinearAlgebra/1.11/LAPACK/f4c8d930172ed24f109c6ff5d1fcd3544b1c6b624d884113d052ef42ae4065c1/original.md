```
posv!(uplo, A, B) -> (A, B)
```

Finds the solution to `A * X = B` where `A` is a symmetric or Hermitian positive definite matrix. If `uplo = U` the upper Cholesky decomposition of `A` is computed. If `uplo = L` the lower Cholesky decomposition of `A` is computed. `A` is overwritten by its Cholesky decomposition. `B` is overwritten with the solution `X`.
