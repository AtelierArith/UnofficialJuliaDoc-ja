```
gecon!(normtype, A, anorm)
```

Finds the reciprocal condition number of matrix `A`. If `normtype = I`, the condition number is found in the infinity norm. If `normtype = O` or `1`, the condition number is found in the one norm. `A` must be the result of `getrf!` and `anorm` is the norm of `A` in the relevant norm.
