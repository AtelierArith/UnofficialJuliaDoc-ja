```
getrs!(trans, A, ipiv, B)
```

Solves the linear equation `A * X = B`, `transpose(A) * X = B`, or `adjoint(A) * X = B` for square `A`. Modifies the matrix/vector `B` in place with the solution. `A` is the `LU` factorization from `getrf!`, with `ipiv` the pivoting information. `trans` may be one of `N` (no modification), `T` (transpose), or `C` (conjugate transpose).
