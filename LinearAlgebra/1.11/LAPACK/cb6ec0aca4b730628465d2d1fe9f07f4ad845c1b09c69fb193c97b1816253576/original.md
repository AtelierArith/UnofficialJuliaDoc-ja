```
gebrd!(A) -> (A, d, e, tauq, taup)
```

Reduce `A` in-place to bidiagonal form `A = QBP'`. Returns `A`, containing the bidiagonal matrix `B`; `d`, containing the diagonal elements of `B`; `e`, containing the off-diagonal elements of `B`; `tauq`, containing the elementary reflectors representing `Q`; and `taup`, containing the elementary reflectors representing `P`.
