```
LinearAlgebra.peakflops(n::Integer=4096; eltype::DataType=Float64, ntrials::Integer=3, parallel::Bool=false)
```

`peakflops` computes the peak flop rate of the computer by using double precision [`gemm!`](@ref LinearAlgebra.BLAS.gemm!). By default, if no arguments are specified, it multiplies two `Float64` matrices of size `n x n`, where `n = 4096`. If the underlying BLAS is using multiple threads, higher flop rates are realized. The number of BLAS threads can be set with [`BLAS.set_num_threads(n)`](@ref).

If the keyword argument `eltype` is provided, `peakflops` will construct matrices with elements of type `eltype` for calculating the peak flop rate.

By default, `peakflops` will use the best timing from 3 trials. If the `ntrials` keyword argument is provided, `peakflops` will use those many trials for picking the best timing.

If the keyword argument `parallel` is set to `true`, `peakflops` is run in parallel on all the worker processors. The flop rate of the entire parallel computer is returned. When running in parallel, only 1 BLAS thread is used. The argument `n` still refers to the size of the problem that is solved on each processor.
