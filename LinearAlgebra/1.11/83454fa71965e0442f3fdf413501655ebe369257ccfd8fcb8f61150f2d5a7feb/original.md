```
norm(A, p::Real=2)
```

For any iterable container `A` (including arrays of any dimension) of numbers (or any element type for which `norm` is defined), compute the `p`-norm (defaulting to `p=2`) as if `A` were a vector of the corresponding length.

The `p`-norm is defined as

$$
\|A\|_p = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n | a_i | ^p \right)^{1/p}
$$

with $a_i$ the entries of $A$, $| a_i |$ the [`norm`](@ref) of $a_i$, and $n$ the length of $A$. Since the `p`-norm is computed using the [`norm`](@ref)s of the entries of `A`, the `p`-norm of a vector of vectors is not compatible with the interpretation of it as a block vector in general if `p != 2`.

`p` can assume any numeric value (even though not all values produce a mathematically valid vector norm). In particular, `norm(A, Inf)` returns the largest value in `abs.(A)`, whereas `norm(A, -Inf)` returns the smallest. If `A` is a matrix and `p=2`, then this is equivalent to the Frobenius norm.

The second argument `p` is not necessarily a part of the interface for `norm`, i.e. a custom type may only implement `norm(A)` without second argument.

Use [`opnorm`](@ref) to compute the operator norm of a matrix.

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, -2, 6]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  3
 -2
  6

julia> norm(v)
7.0

julia> norm(v, 1)
11.0

julia> norm(v, Inf)
6.0

julia> norm([1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9])
16.881943016134134

julia> norm([1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9])
16.881943016134134

julia> norm(1:9)
16.881943016134134

julia> norm(hcat(v,v), 1) == norm(vcat(v,v), 1) != norm([v,v], 1)
true

julia> norm(hcat(v,v), 2) == norm(vcat(v,v), 2) == norm([v,v], 2)
true

julia> norm(hcat(v,v), Inf) == norm(vcat(v,v), Inf) != norm([v,v], Inf)
true
```
