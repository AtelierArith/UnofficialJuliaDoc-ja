ldlt(S::SymTridiagonal) -> LDLt
```

Compute an `LDLt` (i.e., $LDL^T$) factorization of the real symmetric tridiagonal matrix `S` such that `S = L*Diagonal(d)*L'` where `L` is a unit lower triangular matrix and `d` is a vector. The main use of an `LDLt` factorization `F = ldlt(S)` is to solve the linear system of equations `Sx = b` with `F\b`.

See also [`bunchkaufman`](@ref) for a similar, but pivoted, factorization of arbitrary symmetric or Hermitian matrices.

 1.0  4.0  2.0
  ⋅   2.0  5.0

julia> ldltS = ldlt(S);
