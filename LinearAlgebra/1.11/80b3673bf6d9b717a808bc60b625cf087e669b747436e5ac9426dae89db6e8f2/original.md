```
eigen(A; permute::Bool=true, scale::Bool=true, sortby) -> Eigen
```

Compute the eigenvalue decomposition of `A`, returning an [`Eigen`](@ref) factorization object `F` which contains the eigenvalues in `F.values` and the eigenvectors in the columns of the matrix `F.vectors`. This corresponds to solving an eigenvalue problem of the form `Ax =  λx`, where `A` is a matrix, `x` is an eigenvector, and `λ` is an eigenvalue. (The `k`th eigenvector can be obtained from the slice `F.vectors[:, k]`.)

Iterating the decomposition produces the components `F.values` and `F.vectors`.

The following functions are available for `Eigen` objects: [`inv`](@ref), [`det`](@ref), and [`isposdef`](@ref).

For general nonsymmetric matrices it is possible to specify how the matrix is balanced before the eigenvector calculation. The option `permute=true` permutes the matrix to become closer to upper triangular, and `scale=true` scales the matrix by its diagonal elements to make rows and columns more equal in norm. The default is `true` for both options.

By default, the eigenvalues and vectors are sorted lexicographically by `(real(λ),imag(λ))`. A different comparison function `by(λ)` can be passed to `sortby`, or you can pass `sortby=nothing` to leave the eigenvalues in an arbitrary order.   Some special matrix types (e.g. [`Diagonal`](@ref) or [`SymTridiagonal`](@ref)) may implement their own sorting convention and not accept a `sortby` keyword.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> F = eigen([1.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 3.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 18.0])
Eigen{Float64, Float64, Matrix{Float64}, Vector{Float64}}
values:
3-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
  3.0
 18.0
vectors:
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  1.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  1.0

julia> F.values
3-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
  3.0
 18.0

julia> F.vectors
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  1.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  1.0

julia> vals, vecs = F; # destructuring via iteration

julia> vals == F.values && vecs == F.vectors
true
```
