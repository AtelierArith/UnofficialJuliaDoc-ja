```
ldlt!(F::CHOLMOD.Factor, A::SparseMatrixCSC; shift = 0.0, check = true) -> CHOLMOD.Factor
```

Compute the $LDL'$ factorization of `A`, reusing the symbolic factorization `F`. `A` must be a [`SparseMatrixCSC`](@ref) or a [`Symmetric`](@ref)/[`Hermitian`](@ref) view of a `SparseMatrixCSC`. Note that even if `A` doesn't have the type tag, it must still be symmetric or Hermitian.

See also [`ldlt`](@ref).

!!! note
    This method uses the CHOLMOD library from [SuiteSparse](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse), which only supports real or complex types in single or double precision. Input matrices not of those element types will be converted to these types as appropriate.
