```
sprand([rng],[T::Type],m,[n],p::AbstractFloat)
sprand([rng],m,[n],p::AbstractFloat,[rfn=rand])
```

Create a random length `m` sparse vector or `m` by `n` sparse matrix, in which the probability of any element being nonzero is independently given by `p` (and hence the mean density of nonzeros is also exactly `p`). The optional `rng` argument specifies a random number generator, see [Random Numbers](@ref). The optional `T` argument specifies the element type, which defaults to `Float64`.

By default, nonzero values are sampled from a uniform distribution using the [`rand`](@ref) function, i.e. by `rand(T)`, or `rand(rng, T)` if `rng` is supplied; for the default `T=Float64`, this corresponds to nonzero values sampled uniformly in `[0,1)`.

You can sample nonzero values from a different distribution by passing a custom `rfn` function instead of `rand`.   This should be a function `rfn(k)` that returns an array of `k` random numbers sampled from the desired distribution; alternatively, if `rng` is supplied, it should instead be a function `rfn(rng, k)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using Random; Random.seed!(1234))
julia> sprand(Bool, 2, 2, 0.5)
2×2 SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 2 stored entries:
 1  1
 ⋅  ⋅

julia> sprand(Float64, 3, 0.75)
3-element SparseVector{Float64, Int64} with 2 stored entries:
  [1]  =  0.795547
  [2]  =  0.49425
```
