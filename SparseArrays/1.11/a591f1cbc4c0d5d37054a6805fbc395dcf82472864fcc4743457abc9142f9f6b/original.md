```
rowvals(A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC)
```

Return a vector of the row indices of `A`. Any modifications to the returned vector will mutate `A` as well. Providing access to how the row indices are stored internally can be useful in conjunction with iterating over structural nonzero values. See also [`nonzeros`](@ref) and [`nzrange`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = sparse(2I, 3, 3)
3×3 SparseMatrixCSC{Int64, Int64} with 3 stored entries:
 2  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  2  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  2

julia> rowvals(A)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```
