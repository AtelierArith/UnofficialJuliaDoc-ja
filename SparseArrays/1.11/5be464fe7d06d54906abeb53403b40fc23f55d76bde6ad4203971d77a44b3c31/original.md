```
sparse_hvcat(rows::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, values...)
```

Sparse horizontal and vertical concatenation in one call. This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument specifies the number of arguments to concatenate in each block row.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This method was added in Julia 1.8. It mimics previous concatenation behavior, where the concatenation with specialized "sparse" matrix types from LinearAlgebra.jl automatically yielded sparse output even in the absence of any SparseArray argument.
