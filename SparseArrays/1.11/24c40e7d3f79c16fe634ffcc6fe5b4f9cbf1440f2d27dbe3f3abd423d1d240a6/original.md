```
adjoint!(X::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}) where {Tv,Ti}
```

Transpose the matrix `A` and stores the adjoint of the elements in the matrix `X`. `size(X)` must be equal to `size(transpose(A))`. No additional memory is allocated other than resizing the rowval and nzval of `X`, if needed.

See `halfperm!`
