```
uuid1([rng::AbstractRNG]) -> UUID
```

Generates a version 1 (time-based) universally unique identifier (UUID), as specified by RFC 4122. Note that the Node ID is randomly generated (does not identify the host) according to section 4.5 of the RFC.

The default rng used by `uuid1` is not `Random.default_rng()` and every invocation of `uuid1()` without an argument should be expected to return a unique identifier. Importantly, the outputs of `uuid1` do not repeat even when `Random.seed!(seed)` is called. Currently (as of Julia 1.6), `uuid1` uses `Random.RandomDevice` as the default rng. However, this is an implementation detail that may change in the future.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    The output of `uuid1` does not depend on `Random.default_rng()` as of Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"[a-z0-9]{8}-([a-z0-9]{4}-){3}[a-z0-9]{12}"
julia> using Random

julia> rng = MersenneTwister(1234);

julia> uuid1(rng)
UUID("cfc395e8-590f-11e8-1f13-43a2532b2fa8")
```
