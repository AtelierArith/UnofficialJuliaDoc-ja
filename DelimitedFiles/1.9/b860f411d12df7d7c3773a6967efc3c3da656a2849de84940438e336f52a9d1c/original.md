```
readdlm(source; options...)
```

The columns are assumed to be separated by one or more whitespaces. The end of line delimiter is taken as `\n`. If all data is numeric, the result will be a numeric array. If some elements cannot be parsed as numbers, a heterogeneous array of numbers and strings is returned.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> using DelimitedFiles

julia> x = [1; 2; 3; 4];

julia> y = ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"];

julia> open("delim_file.txt", "w") do io
           writedlm(io, [x y])
       end;

julia> readdlm("delim_file.txt")
4Ã—2 Matrix{Any}:
 1  "a"
 2  "b"
 3  "c"
 4  "d"

julia> rm("delim_file.txt")
```
