```
randjump(r::MersenneTwister, steps::Integer) -> MersenneTwister
```

Create an initialized `MersenneTwister` object, whose state is moved forward (without generating numbers) from `r` by `steps` steps. One such step corresponds to the generation of two `Float64` numbers. For each different value of `steps`, a large polynomial has to be generated internally. One is already pre-computed for `steps=big(10)^20`.
