```
islinklocaladdr(addr::IPAddr)
```

Tests if an IP address is a link-local address. Link-local addresses are not guaranteed to be unique beyond their network segment, therefore routers do not forward them. Link-local addresses are from the address blocks `169.254.0.0/16` or `fe80::/10`.

# Examples

```julia
filter(!islinklocaladdr, getipaddrs())
```
