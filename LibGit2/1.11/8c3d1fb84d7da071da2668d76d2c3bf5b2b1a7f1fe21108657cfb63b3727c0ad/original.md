```
LibGit2.rebase!(repo::GitRepo, upstream::AbstractString="", newbase::AbstractString="")
```

Attempt an automatic merge rebase of the current branch, from `upstream` if provided, or otherwise from the upstream tracking branch. `newbase` is the branch to rebase onto. By default this is `upstream`.

If any conflicts arise which cannot be automatically resolved, the rebase will abort, leaving the repository and working tree in its original state, and the function will throw a `GitError`. This is roughly equivalent to the following command line statement:

```
git rebase --merge [<upstream>]
if [ -d ".git/rebase-merge" ]; then
    git rebase --abort
fi
```
