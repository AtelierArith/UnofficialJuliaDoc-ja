```
LibGit2.revcount(repo::GitRepo, commit1::AbstractString, commit2::AbstractString)
```

List the number of revisions between `commit1` and `commit2` (committish OIDs in string form). Since `commit1` and `commit2` may be on different branches, `revcount` performs a "left-right" revision list (and count), returning a tuple of `Int`s - the number of left and right commits, respectively. A left (or right) commit refers to which side of a symmetric difference in a tree the commit is reachable from.

Equivalent to `git rev-list --left-right --count <commit1> <commit2>`.

# Examples

```julia
repo = LibGit2.GitRepo(repo_path)
repo_file = open(joinpath(repo_path, test_file), "a")
println(repo_file, "hello world")
flush(repo_file)
LibGit2.add!(repo, test_file)
commit_oid1 = LibGit2.commit(repo, "commit 1")
println(repo_file, "hello world again")
flush(repo_file)
LibGit2.add!(repo, test_file)
commit_oid2 = LibGit2.commit(repo, "commit 2")
LibGit2.revcount(repo, string(commit_oid1), string(commit_oid2))
```

This will return `(-1, 0)`.
