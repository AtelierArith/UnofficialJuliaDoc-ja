```
treewalk(f, tree::GitTree, post::Bool=false)
```

Traverse the entries in `tree` and its subtrees in post or pre order. Preorder means beginning at the root and then traversing the leftmost subtree (and recursively on down through that subtree's leftmost subtrees) and moving right through the subtrees. Postorder means beginning at the bottom of the leftmost subtree, traversing upwards through it, then traversing the next right subtree (again beginning at the bottom) and finally visiting the tree root last of all.

The function parameter `f` should have following signature:

```
(String, GitTreeEntry) -> Cint
```

A negative value returned from `f` stops the tree walk. A positive value means that the entry will be skipped if `post` is `false`.
