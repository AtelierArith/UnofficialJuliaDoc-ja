```
reject(payload::CredentialPayload; shred::Bool=true) -> Nothing

Discard the `payload` credential from begin re-used in future authentication. Should only be called when authentication was unsuccessful.

The `shred` keyword controls whether sensitive information in the payload credential field should be destroyed. Should only be set to `false` during testing.
