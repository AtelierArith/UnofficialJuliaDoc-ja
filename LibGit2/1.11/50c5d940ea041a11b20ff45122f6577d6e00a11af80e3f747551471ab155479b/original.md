GitAnnotated(repo::GitRepo, commit_id::GitHash)
GitAnnotated(repo::GitRepo, ref::GitReference)
GitAnnotated(repo::GitRepo, fh::FetchHead)
GitAnnotated(repo::GitRepo, committish::AbstractString)
```

An annotated git commit carries with it information about how it was looked up and why, so that rebase or merge operations have more information about the context of the commit. Conflict files contain information about the source/target branches in the merge which are conflicting, for instance. An annotated commit can refer to the tip of a remote branch, for instance when a [`FetchHead`](@ref) is passed, or to a branch head described using `GitReference`.
