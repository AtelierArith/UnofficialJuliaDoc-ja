LibGit2.BlameHunk
```

Matches the [`git_blame_hunk`](https://libgit2.org/libgit2/#HEAD/type/git_blame_hunk) struct. The fields represent:     * `lines_in_hunk`: the number of lines in this hunk of the blame.     * `final_commit_id`: the [`GitHash`](@ref) of the commit where this section was last changed.     * `final_start_line_number`: the *one based* line number in the file where the        hunk starts, in the *final* version of the file.     * `final_signature`: the signature of the person who last modified this hunk. You will        need to pass this to `Signature` to access its fields.     * `orig_commit_id`: the [`GitHash`](@ref) of the commit where this hunk was first found.     * `orig_path`: the path to the file where the hunk originated. This may be different        than the current/final path, for instance if the file has been moved.     * `orig_start_line_number`: the *one based* line number in the file where the        hunk starts, in the *original* version of the file at `orig_path`.     * `orig_signature`: the signature of the person who introduced this hunk. You will        need to pass this to `Signature` to access its fields.     * `boundary`: `'1'` if the original commit is a "boundary" commit (for instance, if it's        equal to an oldest commit set in `options`).
