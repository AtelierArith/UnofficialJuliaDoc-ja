```
clone(repo_url::AbstractString, repo_path::AbstractString, clone_opts::CloneOptions)
```

Clone the remote repository at `repo_url` (which can be a remote URL or a path on the local filesystem) to `repo_path` (which must be a path on the local filesystem). Options for the clone, such as whether to perform a bare clone or not, are set by [`CloneOptions`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia
repo_url = "https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl"
repo = LibGit2.clone(repo_url, "/home/me/projects/Example")
```
