```
addprocs(manager::ClusterManager; kwargs...) -> List of process identifiers
```

Launches worker processes via the specified cluster manager.

For example, Beowulf clusters are supported via a custom cluster manager implemented in the package `ClusterManagers.jl`.

The number of seconds a newly launched worker waits for connection establishment from the master can be specified via variable `JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT` in the worker process's environment. Relevant only when using TCP/IP as transport.

To launch workers without blocking the REPL, or the containing function if launching workers programmatically, execute `addprocs` in its own task.

# Examples

```julia
# On busy clusters, call `addprocs` asynchronously
t = @async addprocs(...)
```

```julia
# Utilize workers as and when they come online
if nprocs() > 1   # Ensure at least one new worker is available
   ....   # perform distributed execution
end
```

```julia
# Retrieve newly launched worker IDs, or any error messages
if istaskdone(t)   # Check if `addprocs` has completed to ensure `fetch` doesn't block
    if nworkers() == N
        new_pids = fetch(t)
    else
        fetch(t)
    end
end
```
