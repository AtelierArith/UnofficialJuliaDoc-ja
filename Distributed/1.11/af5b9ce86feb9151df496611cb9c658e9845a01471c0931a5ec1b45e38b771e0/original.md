```
clear!(syms, pids=workers(); mod=Main)
```

Clears global bindings in modules by initializing them to `nothing`. `syms` should be of type [`Symbol`](@ref) or a collection of `Symbol`s . `pids` and `mod` identify the processes and the module in which global variables are to be reinitialized. Only those names found to be defined under `mod` are cleared.

An exception is raised if a global constant is requested to be cleared.
