```
process_messages(r_stream::IO, w_stream::IO, incoming::Bool=true)
```

Called by cluster managers using custom transports. It should be called when the custom transport implementation receives the first message from a remote worker. The custom transport must manage a logical connection to the remote worker and provide two `IO` objects, one for incoming messages and the other for messages addressed to the remote worker. If `incoming` is `true`, the remote peer initiated the connection. Whichever of the pair initiates the connection sends the cluster cookie and its Julia version number to perform the authentication handshake.
