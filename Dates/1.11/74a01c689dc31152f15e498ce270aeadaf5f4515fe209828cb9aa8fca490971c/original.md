```
dt::Date + t::Time -> DateTime
```

The addition of a `Date` with a `Time` produces a `DateTime`. The hour, minute, second, and millisecond parts of the `Time` are used along with the year, month, and day of the `Date` to create the new `DateTime`. Non-zero microseconds or nanoseconds in the `Time` type will result in an `InexactError` being thrown.
