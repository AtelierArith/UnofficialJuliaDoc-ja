```
round(x::Period, precision::T, [r::RoundingMode]) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`. By default (`RoundNearestTiesUp`), ties (e.g., rounding 90 minutes to the nearest hour) will be rounded up.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `round(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `round(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> round(Day(16), Week)
2 weeks

julia> round(Minute(44), Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> round(Hour(36), Day)
2 days
```

Valid rounding modes for `round(::Period, ::T, ::RoundingMode)` are `RoundNearestTiesUp` (default), `RoundDown` (`floor`), and `RoundUp` (`ceil`).

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
