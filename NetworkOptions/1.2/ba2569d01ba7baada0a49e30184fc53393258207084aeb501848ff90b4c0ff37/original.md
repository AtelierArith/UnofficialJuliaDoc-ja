```
ca_roots() :: Union{Nothing, String}
```

The `ca_roots()` function tells the caller where, if anywhere, to find a file or directory of PEM-encoded certificate authority roots. By default, on systems like Windows and macOS where the built-in TLS engines know how to verify hosts using the system's built-in certificate verification mechanism, this function will return `nothing`. On classic UNIX systems (excluding macOS), root certificates are typically stored in a file in `/etc`: the common places for the current UNIX system will be searched and if one of these paths exists, it will be returned; if none of these typical root certificate paths exist, then the path to the set of root certificates that are bundled with Julia is returned.

The default value returned by `ca_roots()` may be overridden by setting the `JULIA_SSL_CA_ROOTS_PATH`, `SSL_CERT_DIR`, or `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variables, in which case this function will always return the value of the first of these variables that is set (whether the path exists or not). If `JULIA_SSL_CA_ROOTS_PATH` is set to the empty string, then the other variables are ignored (as if unset); if the other variables are set to the empty string, they behave is if they are not set.
